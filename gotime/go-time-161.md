**Mat Ryer:** Hello and welcome to the third and final installment of the Go Time GopherCon lunchtime mashup. I'm Mat Ryer, and today, much like the last day of school, we're not gonna be doing any work. Instead, I'm gonna be asking "Would you like to play a game?" Not in like a creepy way, like in the Saw movies, with the weird little clown man riding a tiny bike... But like the American game show Jeopardy. We're gonna have a quiz show, a good old-fashioned quiz show. It's gonna be great. I'll explain the rules in a bit, but first, let's meet the contestants.

Hello, contestants! Let's see who we've got. I can see Kat Zień. Hello, Kat!

**Kat Zień:** Hello. Hi, Mat.

**Mat Ryer:** Senior engineer at Monzo. Last time we spoke you weren't senior engineer, so you got older.

**Kat Zień:** Yeah, I aged.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Well, that's alright... It happens to everyone. We've also got Ellen Körbes. Hello, Ellen.

**L Körbes:** \{04:01\} I am very impressed that you managed to pronounce the surname correctly... Which is disappointing, because I only came here to make fun of you. So yeah, that sucks.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Well, there'll be plenty of opportunity to do that anyway. You are a dev rel at Tilt, right?

**L Körbes:** Yeah. I'm a pretty face, yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. If you do say so yourself.

**L Körbes:** I do, yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Very modest. Yeah, you do. Okay.

**L Körbes:** Yeah, I do.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, we've also got... It's only Mark Bates, isn't it? Creator and maintainer of the Buffalo project, co-founder at Gopher Guides, which does great training. He's also kind of the lightning talks on GopherCon... Thor's jester, he's Mark Bates. Hello, Mr. Bates.

**Mark Bates:** Hey there, Matthew. How are you doing today, sir?

**Mat Ryer:** Not bad. Are you ready to play a game?

**Mark Bates:** That's so creepy when you say it...

**Mat Ryer:** It's a bit creepy, isn't it?

**Mark Bates:** It really is, but yeah...

**L Körbes:** It sounds like the Queen.

**Mat Ryer:** Sounds like what?

**L Körbes:** Like the Queen.

**Mat Ryer:** Sounds like the Queen. Well, does she say that? "Would one like to play a game?" It's very sinister. I'd be like, "No, thanks, your Majesty. I'll just go." Okay.

**Mark Bates:** Alex, what are the rules?

**Mat Ryer:** Yes, here are the rules. So we're gonna show you a gameboard, and for each round we've got one of these boards... And what you do is you take turns picking one of these squares. You can see that they're organized in columns by category. And then the number on the square is the number of points that you're willing to wager. So if you're particularly strong in a certain category, you might go for the 500 or the 400; if you're not sure, maybe stick to the 100 and 200 there.

If you get the answer right, you win the points. If you get the answer wrong, we subtract the points, unfortunately. Now, if you do get it wrong, you will lose the points, but the next person in line will have a chance to steal. But be careful with those steals, because you also will lose the number of points if you get it wrong. So only steal when you're sure.

And we do have a prize, by the way... You will win, whoever wins this, a Raspberry Pi 400, the little keyboard one with a computer inside it. Very exciting. You don't get a screen. If you have a screen, you're gonna have to be entering way more quizzes, and much bigger quizzes than this. So there's no screen, but you can have the little computer anyway.

**Mark Bates:** And there's no power or any other cabling involved. It's just the device.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. You're on your own.

**L Körbes:** Wait, does it come with electricity?

**Mark Bates:** No. And it doesn't come with the key caps, as a matter of fact. You have to buy your own key caps.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. You can save up for a Caps Lock if you really want to... But yeah, it's a good prize.

**Mark Bates:** I'm still hoping for one for Christmas.

**Mat Ryer:** So what do you think of the prize?

**Kat Zień:** I mean, I'm not gonna get it.

**L Körbes:** Doesn't it have an ARM processor? So it's like it's basically the new Macs...

**Mat Ryer:** \[laughs\] I think so, yeah. Well, you don't seem particularly bothered by that prize, but I think it's a great one.

**Mark Bates:** It's pretty cool.

**Mat Ryer:** Shall we get started?

**Mark Bates:** Yes.

**Mat Ryer:** Shall we start the game? Shall we?

**Mark Bates:** Yes, Alex.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Well, we've rolled an invisible dice earlier and come up with this order... So Kat, you're going first. So the first column - it's No-go. All the answers are features that Go doesn't have. Funky Movies - we've replaces Go keywords from popular movies with the word func. For example, if I said the clue was "Catch me func you can", the real movie is "Catch me if you can", so if is the Go keyword we were looking for. They'll be obvious when we see them; it'll be fine.

**L Körbes:** This is like \[unintelligible 00:07:45.26\]

**Mat Ryer:** It's okay, don't worry; it's not as hard as it sounds, I promise, once we get going.

**Mark Bates:** I don't know, I was promised there'd be no math.

**Mat Ryer:** \[laughs\] Groups Who Go -- you can subtract, Mark, which is essentially all you're gonna need...

**Mark Bates:** I'm not that good at that either... Go on.

**Mat Ryer:** \{08:06\} Groups Who Go - the answers are groups from around the world, groups of Gophers. That's a cool one. And we've got Pike's Proverbs, where you are gonna be asked to fill in the blanks from Rob Pike's Go proverbs.

Okay, now we know the categories... Kat, would you like to pick your first square, please?

**Kat Zień:** Yeah, I'll go for Groups Who Go for 100.

**Mat Ryer:** Groups Who Go for 100. This group builds bridges to educate under-represented communities and to foster diversity in Go.

**Kat Zień:** Is it GoBridge?

**Mat Ryer:** So answer in the form of a question... Let's see... \[win sound\] Yes, correct. So you get the 100 points. See? Now so bad, eh? Okay, L, it's your turn now.

**L Körbes:** Let's do Funky Movies for 500.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, straight in 500 there...

**L Körbes:** I mean, if I'm gonna lose, I'm gonna lose big.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay... The Funcstant Gardener.

**L Körbes:** Yeah... How do I make this a question?

**Mat Ryer:** Don't worry about that...

**L Körbes:** Okay, it's const.

**Mat Ryer:** Const, let's see... \[win sound\] Correct! Brilliant.

**L Körbes:** Yay!

**Kat Zień:** Nice.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, so you've got 500 points there. That's nice. Mr. Bates, time for you to pick a square, sir.

**Mark Bates:** I will take Funky Movies for 400.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, Funky Movies. Batman Funks.

**Mark Bates:** What is return?

**Mat Ryer:** \[win sound\] Yes. Brilliant. For 400.

**Mark Bates:** I know.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, back to Kat.

**L Körbes:** Wait, wait, wait... Mat's not playing?

**Mark Bates:** No, he's the host.

**Kat Zień:** He knows all the answers.

**L Körbes:** So we can't make Mat lose? This is the worst...

**Mat Ryer:** No, no...

**Mark Bates:** Mat has already lost just being on the air with us.

**L Körbes:** I'm so disappointed.

**Mark Bates:** He's already lost, dealing with us.

**L Körbes:** Okay. Alright, fair enough.

**Kat Zień:** Alright, I'll go with Groups Who Go for 300.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, let's have a look. These seven gophers host weekly conversations from around the Go community.

**Kat Zień:** I don't know, I'm not sure. I'm gonna guess. So if I guess wrong, I get minus points...?

**Mat Ryer:** That's correct, yeah. If you get it wrong.

**Kat Zień:** Can I just not guess then and pass it on?=

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, but you lose the points anyway.

**Kat Zień:** Okay.

**Mat Ryer:** It's a required field.

**Kat Zień:** Okay, I'm gonna say "Is it GoTimeFM?", but that is just a random guess, because I don't know if there's seven of you.

**Mat Ryer:** Let's see... \[win sound\] Correct!

**Kat Zień:** Oh, nice.

**Mat Ryer:** So you win 300 points.

**Kat Zień:** I was counting in my head, I was like "Is it seven people? Is it exactly seven people?" \[laughter\] That's why I was like "I don't really know..."

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. L, what do you reckon now?

**L Körbes:** Let's stick to movies. 300.

**Mat Ryer:** 300, Funky Movies. Point Funk.

**L Körbes:** Oh, man.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Go keyword belongs there.

**L Körbes:** Blank? Is that a keyword? I don't know...

**Mat Ryer:** \[fail sound\] No.

**L Körbes:** Right...

**Mark Bates:** Can I steal?

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, Bates... Hang on, we need to take the 300 points off L first, which we've done... And now, Bates, do you wanna have a go?

**Mark Bates:** What is Break?

**Mat Ryer:** Break? \[win sound\] Yes...

**L Körbes:** See, that's the word I wanted.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Mark Bates:** Yeah, that was the right answer. \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Now it's Mark's turn.

**Mark Bates:** Yeah, let's go for Funky Movies for 200.

**Mat Ryer:** Funky Movies... The Funcportance of Being Earnest.

**Mark Bates:** \[laughs\] It's import...

**Mat Ryer:** \[win sound\] Correct! You're good at these funky movies.

**Mark Bates:** Hey, wouldn't it be Functance? It should have just been Functance.

**L Körbes:** Yeah, exactly.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, yeah. We left it in there because it sounded more funny, and there's gonna be no consequences to this...

**Mark Bates:** Fair enough.

**Mat Ryer:** Kat, it's back to you... What do you reckon?

**Kat Zień:** I'll go Groups Who Go, 400.

**Mat Ryer:** Groups Who Go, for 400. 2,442 developer names and emails are listed in this group on Golang.org. What could it be...? It's a prominent group.

**Kat Zień:** \{12:07\} It's a random guess, so I'm gonna completely randomly guess... But "Who are Release Managers?'

**Mat Ryer:** \[fail sound\] Good guess, but it's not right, I'm afraid. L, do you wanna steal?

**L Körbes:** Um, no.

**Mat Ryer:** Fair enough. Bates, do you wanna steal this one?

**Mark Bates:** I think I know what it is, but I'm not gonna steal.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, you don't wanna risk it. You've got 900...

**Mark Bates:** I'm not gonna risk it. 400 is a lot.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay.

**Mark Bates:** I'm pretty sure it's Contributors, but I'm not answering...

**Mat Ryer:** So you don't want to submit an answer.

**Mark Bates:** I do not wanna submit an answer.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, let's see what the answer was... The Go Contributors. So you would've gotten the 400.

**Mark Bates:** I wouldn't have gotten it, yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** You sure would... Don't worry though, because it's L's turn now.

**L Körbes:** Um, It's a No-Go for 500.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, going straight in that number 500, It's a No-Go. Recursive Go functions might benefit from this compiler optimization.

**L Körbes:** The only thing I know about recursiveness is tail-something-something. Is that a valid answer?

**Mat Ryer:** I mean, you're sort of submitting a regex kind of answer there... \[laughter\] \[unintelligible 00:13:10.00\]

**L Körbes:** Can I google it for a minute?

**Mark Bates:** Google it? I don't think that's allowed... \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** I don't think so... I don't know.

**L Körbes:** Um, what's it called...? Tailend-something-something? Yeah, I think I lost it...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, don't worry then... \[fail sound\] I'm afraid yes, you're gonna fall down into negative points now, which is kind of fun... Bates, do you wanna steal this one?

**Mark Bates:** I can't think of it either. All I can think of is tail... Tailend optimization, or something like that; I'm not gonna guess.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, you're not gonna guess; you're just gonna help Kat. So Kat, do you wanna have a go at this one, steal it?

**Kat Zień:** No... No, I'm not gonna risk it.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, let's see what the answer was. You were so close... Tail call optimization.

**L Körbes:** Oh, tail call...

**Mat Ryer:** Yes, indeed... Okay. It's Bates' turn now.

**Mark Bates:** Hm...

**Mat Ryer:** Pick a square, mate.

**Mark Bates:** Let's do It's a No-Go for 400.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, It's a No-Go for 400. The garbage collector is good, but that hasn't stopped some people from using this technique themselves. It's a No-Go, for 400.

**Mark Bates:** Will you be quiet?

**Mat Ryer:** No, I can't have dead air. \[laughter\] Loads of people just watching you think...

**Mark Bates:** Well, how is that different from the rest of the night? \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** What, L?

**L Körbes:** I was just saying random things just to annoy Mark, because he wants silence, so we can't help it.

**Mark Bates:** Okay, so I have to guess, correct?

**Mat Ryer:** Yes, you have to have a guess.

**Mark Bates:** I have to take a guess, okay.

**Mat Ryer:** Or you can pass and lose the 400.

**Mark Bates:** So the garbage collector is good, but that hasn't stopped some people from using this technique themselves... And I'm going to say manual garbage collection.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, that is so close... \[fail sound\] I'm probably gonna -- okay, the soundbot has rejected... \[fail sound\] Okay, soundbot, calm down. Soundbot says no, that means Kat -- \[fail sound\]. Yeah, thank you, soundbot. Kat, would you like to steal this one?

**Kat Zień:** No, because I'm not entirely sure on the wording. If Mark's guess was not correct, then I don't know what the right word is... I would have called it the same.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. L, do you wanna steal this one?

**L Körbes:** Um, nope.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay... Let's see what the answer was. You were very close; I would have probably given you this.

**Mark Bates:** Garbage collector \[unintelligible 00:15:22.26\]

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, manual memory management. No matter, we've taken the points off you.

**Mark Bates:** I feel like I should've gotten that one... But anyway, let's move on.

**Mat Ryer:** It was the soundbot... \[fail sound\] You can't argue with an 8-bit sound effect.

**Mark Bates:** Well, you know what then? I'm gonna take this to the Supreme Court.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, please do.

**Mark Bates:** I'm contesting the entire results of this game.

**Mat Ryer:** Too soon.

**Mark Bates:** Too soon? Okay. \[laughs\] I'll just get yelled at...

**Mat Ryer:** Kat, it's time to pick a square.

**Kat Zień:** I'll go for -- let's do Pike's Proverbs for 100, see what that's like.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, let's have a look. "Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by... What."

**Kat Zień:** \{16:05\} Is it communicating?

**Mat Ryer:** Is it? \[win sound\] Yes! You got an 8-bit fanfare.

**Kat Zień:** Yaay!

**Mat Ryer:** Congrats. L.

**L Körbes:** Um Pike's Proverbs for 500.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, Pike's Proverbs for 500. "A little copying is better than a little... What."

**L Körbes:** Right, I remember this...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, say it then.

**L Körbes:** Well, I remember the part that's on the screen. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Oh yeah, yeah. I remember that bit as well.

**L Körbes:** A little copying is better than a little... Hm...

**Mat Ryer:** What could it be...?

**L Körbes:** Ah, words...

**Kat Zień:** Pasting? \[laughs\]

**L Körbes:** Yeah, that's the first thing that comes to mind.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Well, there's no point copying if you're not gonna paste it.

**L Körbes:** I wanna say something like abstractioning, but that's not a word, so it can't be the real answer.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, you could say abstraction if you want. That would fit.

**L Körbes:** Okay, let's go with that.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. 8-bit sound effect... \[fail sound\] Oh, sorry. It's not correct.

**L Körbes:** Of course I lost.

**Mat Ryer:** Bates, would you like to steal this?

**Mark Bates:** Ah, it's killing me... No. No, I would not.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Kat?

**Kat Zień:** If it wasn't for 500, I would've guessed... But I'm too afraid to guess. I have an idea, but... Nah.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. You're gonna pass. Let's see -- what was your idea? Oh, it doesn't matter.

**L Körbes:** Oh, dependency...

**Mat Ryer:** Dependency. A little copying is better than a little dependency. So you were with it with the abstraction thing, but it wasn't correct.

**L Körbes:** Yeah, words... Words are bad.

**Kat Zień:** I was gonna say cleverness, but... Yeah.

**L Körbes:** Yeah, that's good.

**Mat Ryer:** Bates, pick a square, my friend.

**Mark Bates:** Let's do Pike's Proverbs for 400, Alex.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay... Make the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ value useful.

**L Körbes:** Oh, that's so easy. It's so unfair.

**Mark Bates:** What is zero?

**Mat Ryer:** What is zero. \[win sound\] Yes, correct. 400 points.

**Mark Bates:** I'm fair. \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Kat, back to you.

**Kat Zień:** Oh, me again?

**Mat Ryer:** What do you reckon, mate?

**Kat Zień:** Let's go with Pike's Proverbs, 200.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay... "Cgo is not... What." What is cgo not?

**Kat Zień:** That's Pike's?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, one of Pike's proverbs. Cgo is not what. What is it not? It's like a Dr. Seuss book, ain't it?

**Kat Zień:** Is it Go?

**Mat Ryer:** Let's see. \[win sound\] Yes.

**Kat Zień:** I was like, "That's too obvious to be it..." \[laughter\] I was like "I feel like there's a catch."

**Mat Ryer:** No. Great. Great one. L, you're behind at the moment.

**L Körbes:** Right. Let's keep digging this hole. Groups Who Go, for 500.

**Mat Ryer:** Groups Who Go, for 500. Kenneth Shaw organizes this group of 8,573 Gophers in Indonesia, Meetup.com's largest Go meetup.

**L Körbes:** This is the Go Indonesia Group... \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Maybe... Is that your answer? I mean...

**L Körbes:** No, actually... Is it?

**Mat Ryer:** I don't know.

**L Körbes:** Is it GopherCon Australia maybe? Because it's like in that part of the globe, right?

**Mat Ryer:** Right. So what's your final answer? For 500, do your answer, please...

**L Körbes:** Y'all gotta keep talking because dead air, and I need to think for a second... \[laughter\]

**Kat Zień:** Ellen's like "Here's a map..."

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah... Kenneth Shaw, 8,573.

**Kat Zień:** I remember talking to him.

**Mat Ryer:** Wow.

**L Körbes:** Who is he?

**Kat Zień:** I remember at some point we had -- I think it was GopherCon U.K, when he had a Meetups Organizers catch-up, and he dialed in from Indonesia. It was pretty funny, because it was day for him, and I think late afternoon for us... Would that make sense? No...

**Mat Ryer:** Hm. That sounds hilarious.

**L Körbes:** I'm gonna go with The Go Indonesia Meetup, because I don't have a better guess than that.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, fair enough. \[fail sound\] It's incorrect, I'm afraid. Bates, would you like to steal?

**Mark Bates:** No... I'm pretty sure -- I think I know what it is, but no. It's too many points.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay... Kat, you get to steal this then, if you wanna have a Go. You've met the person, you spoke to them about their meetup...

**Kat Zień:** \{20:19\} That's the thing, but I don't wanna mess up the meetup name...

**Mat Ryer:** Right. What's your guess then, mate?

**L Körbes:** I already did that, so...

**Kat Zień:** I don't know, I don't wanna steal this.

**Mat Ryer:** You don't have to steal.

**Kat Zień:** Yeah, I'm not gonna remember the actual meetup's name. I thought it was--

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, no problem. Let's find out. The answer was...

**Kat Zień:** Show us what it is.

**Mat Ryer:** Go Jakarta.

**Kat Zień:** Oh, yes... Yeah.

**L Körbes:** Right.

**Mat Ryer:** The capital city of Indonesia.

**L Körbes:** If only I knew that...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Don't worry.

**Mark Bates:** That was gonna be my guess, but I didn't wanna mess up the name... Like Kat said.

**Mat Ryer:** No one believes you.

**Kat Zień:** \[unintelligible 00:20:50.18\]

**Mark Bates:** I was gonna say like The Jakarta Gophers, or Go Group, but I didn't wanna screw it up.

**Mat Ryer:** Too late. Way too late. But it's your turn now though, Bates, so you can show us, instead of telling us how clever you are...

**Mark Bates:** I'll take the Proverbs -- I am clever. I'll take Proverbs with 300, sir.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Clear is better than \*beep\*. What's the beep? What's clear better than?

**Mark Bates:** What is clever?

**Mat Ryer:** \[win sound\] Correct. 300 points to you, Mr. Bates. Okay, back to Kat.

**Kat Zień:** Let's do Groups Who Go for 200.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, let's see. She runs a local chapter to help build a more diverse and inclusive Go community.

**Mark Bates:** It feels like that could be a lot of people...

**Kat Zień:** I could think of a few she's...

**Mat Ryer:** It's the name of a group we're looking for, not a particular person.

**Kat Zień:** Oh okay, so it's the name of the group. Who is Women Who Go? Are you looking for the general group name?

**Mat Ryer:** \[win sound\] Correct! Yes, nice one. Some points.

**Mark Bates:** Some really weird questions...

**Kat Zień:** Good thing you clarified, because I was like "I know quite a few she's who run that, so..." \[laughs\]

**Mark Bates:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** We're not taking pull requests for the quiz, so... You can keep those opinions. Keep them to yourselves. \[laughter\] L, it's your turn. You've got -1,300 points so far, but you can claw some back.

**Mark Bates:** You can still catch up!

**L Körbes:** Numerically, I have the largest score, so... There you go, suckers.

**Mat Ryer:** Right. Yeah, if we just absolute scores.

**L Körbes:** No-Go for 300.

**Mat Ryer:** No-Go for 300. Go has explicit error handling, so you won't find these keywords common to other languages.

**L Körbes:** Yeah, right. I remember this.

**Mat Ryer:** Right?

**L Körbes:** Yeah. Throw. Catch.

**Mat Ryer:** Let's see. \[win sound\] Yes...! Throw, try, and/or catch. And and or are not included in that, by the way. Correct. Okay.

**Mark Bates:** We don't have those in Go either...

**L Körbes:** My score went down now...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, yeah. Well, it still looks really low, but you did claw some back. Don't worry, there's plenty of other chances to win some points. Okay, Mr. Bates.

**Mark Bates:** Yes, I will take Funky Movies, please.

**Mat Ryer:** Funky Movies... The Curious Funk of Benjamin Button.

**L Körbes:** \[laughs\]

**Mark Bates:** What is case?

**Mat Ryer:** \[win sound\] What is case indeed. Correct. Kat, it's your turn.

**Kat Zień:** It's a No-Go for 100, because I'm not too clever.

**Mat Ryer:** This form of polymorphism common in many languages is likely coming to Go soon.

**Kat Zień:** What is generics?!

**Mat Ryer:** \[win sound\] Yes! Nice one, congrats. L, you're left with It's a No-Go for 200. You won't find the "class" keyword in Go. That's because the language isn't this.

**L Körbes:** Object-oriented?

**Mat Ryer:** Let's see... \[win sound\] Congratulations! And that's the end of round one.

**L Körbes:** No...! My numbers went down again.

**Mark Bates:** How many more rounds are there?

**Mat Ryer:** There's three rounds.

**Mark Bates:** Oh, okay.

**Mat Ryer:** Let's have a look at the scores. We have a way-behind, unfortunately, on -800; it's L. Next it's Kat at 600, but taking the lead there is Mr. Bates, with thirteen hundred, or one thousand three hundred, depending on whose side you're on. Well done! How do you feel so far about your quiz?

**Kat Zień:** \{24:17\} Not great, not terrible. I'm in the middle. \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Yeah, we can have some chat now. This is chat time, so let's get to meet our guests a little more. Mark, what's your guilty pleasure?

**Mark Bates:** I can't say that on the air...!

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. L, what's the worst thing you've ever done? \[laughter\] It's just light chat. Keep it light.

**Mark Bates:** Just keep it light. MURDER.

**L Körbes:** Um, yeah, so I plead the 5th here, or whichever that one is...

**Mark Bates:** Well, the 5th is the correct one, L. That's right. \[laughs\]

**L Körbes:** Okay, yeah. Alright.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, you didn't accidentally plead one about farming, one of the amendments about farming, or something...

**L Körbes:** I mean, it did happen in a farm, but I can't say what it is.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, well--

**Mark Bates:** I think the 4th amendment is the one about not housing soldiers, or something. There's an amendment particularly about being forced to house soldiers.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, right.

**L Körbes:** I've never housed a soldier. I can come clean about that and say it for everyone who's watching.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay.

**Mark Bates:** There you go. Fantastic.

**Mat Ryer:** I'm sure that puts a lot of minds at rest.

**Mark Bates:** I was worried... \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** I get that question all the time, about you. Strange.

**L Körbes:** I know...

**Break:** \{25:37\}

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, shall we move on to round two, shall we?

**Kat Zień:** Gopher it!

**Mat Ryer:** Let's do it. I'll explain these categories now. On the left there we have Standard Librarians... We're gonna read the description of a standard library package, and you have to just tell us which package we're describing. We're taking it from the GoDocs.

The next category, GitHub Stars. These are the top-starred Go repos on GitHub. All of the answers are those repos.

We also have Gopherpedia, which is actually real-life gopher animal facts that we've found on Wikipedia. So that one has actually nothing to do with computers.

And the final one, Go Doesn't Equal Golang - these are pop culture things with Go in their name, but they're not related to the language that we all love, Go.

Right, time to start... Kat. Contestant number one, Kat Zień. That's how you say your name, right?

**Kat Zień:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** It sounds to me like someone's just made a load of money, and they're like Kat-Zień! You know what I mean?

**Kat Zień:** Yeah, ka-ching...! \[laughs\] Yeah, everyone always says it sounds Chinese, but it has nothing to do with Asia, as far as I know.

**Mat Ryer:** Good name. Do you wanna pick -- oh, notice we've doubled. This is double panic.

**L Körbes:** Okay, sorry, now I need to ask - where is the surname from?

**Kat Zień:** Poland.

**L Körbes:** Oh, cool.

**Kat Zień:** \{28:06\} Yeah, nobody ever gets that the first time they guess.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, fair enough, ain't it.

**Kat Zień:** It's not \[unintelligible 00:28:10.20\] \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Okay.

**Kat Zień:** Right.

**Mat Ryer:** I need to just tell you this, Kat - it's Double Panic this round, so notice all the scores have doubled.

**Kat Zień:** Doubled, yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Go on then.

**Kat Zień:** Let's go GitHub Stars for 200.

**Mat Ryer:** GitHub Stars for 200. The world's fastest framework for building static websites.

**Kat Zień:** Wait, wait, wait... What is the -- oh, I'm blanking on the name. I'm thinking of the PHP one \[unintelligible e00:28:41.04\] Wait, wait, wait... Oh, we're using this for London Gophers; come on, I'm so rubbish with names... \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** It's also late for you. It's later for you than it is for Mr. Bates, for example... But let's just--

**Mark Bates:** You don't know what I've been doing last night.

**Mat Ryer:** True. I haven't watched the videos yet.

**Mark Bates:** Maybe I haven't gone to bed.

**Kat Zień:** I can't remember what the static website builder is... I'm sorry.

**Mat Ryer:** \[fail sound\] Okay.

**Mark Bates:** Can I steal?

**Mat Ryer:** No, not yet. We need to see if L wants to steal first. L, do you wanna steal?

**L Körbes:** Yeah, it's Hugo.

**Kat Zień:** Oh, come on...!

**Mat Ryer:** Is it? \[win sound\] Yes, Hugo. Correct. 200 points.

**Kat Zień:** Steve's gonna be so disappointed. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Okay... L, it's now your turn to choose a square.

**L Körbes:** Right. Let's go with the weird category that I don't understand, the last one. Let's do 600.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, Go Doesn't Equal Golang. So the answer to this is gonna be something Go, but not related to what we do. This 2016 augmented reality game for iOS and Android was downloaded more than 500 million times that year.

**L Körbes:** What I really loved about that game was all the conspiracy theories around it. It's better than sci-fi, man... It's Pokémon Go.

**Mat Ryer:** \[win sound\] Correct. Well done. Clawing some points back. Now all the way up to zero. Well done.

**L Körbes:** \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Mr. Bates. Pick a square, sir.

**Mark Bates:** I will take Go Doesn't Equal Golang for 1,000.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, he's going big...

**Mark Bates:** Going big.

**Mat Ryer:** A line of transforming robot toys produced by Tonka from 1983 to 1987.

**Mark Bates:** What were the GoBots?

**Mat Ryer:** \[win sound\] What were those GoBots. Correct. Well done. Lots of points, look at that.

**L Körbes:** You guys are really old, right? \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** \{30:47\} yes. But yes, I used to own GoBots. They were like the really cheap transformers; my mother would buy them at like CVS. They were terrible.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, don't lumber me in the geriatric bucket with Mr. Bates, please. \[laughter\] Kat, it's time for you to choose a square.

**Kat Zień:** Let's try Gopherpedia for 200.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, Gopherpedia. Much like mice and rats, gophers are mammals of this order.

**Kat Zień:** What are rodents?

**Mat Ryer:** \[win sound\] Correct!

**Kat Zień:** Oh.

**Mat Ryer:** I would have also accepted rodentia.

**Kat Zień:** Really? Gophers are rodents?

**L Körbes:** Yeah... Have you seen their teeth? They're like big hamsters.

**Kat Zień:** Yeah... But they're cute. Rodents are not cute.

**Mat Ryer:** Some are, I suppose... Cuteness is in the eyeballs of the beholder, I always say. I don't always say it...

**L Körbes:** True.

**Mat Ryer:** L, maybe we could get you some points. Pick a square, please.

**L Körbes:** Let's do Standard Libraries for 400.

**Mat Ryer:** Standard Librarians, for 400. Implements formatted IO with functions analogous to C's printf and scanf.

**L Körbes:** \{31:58\} That is the fmt package.

**Mat Ryer:** \[win sound\] It sure is. Nice one. And you're off the mark. Speaking of marks... Bates, pick a square, please.

**Mark Bates:** I will take Go Doesn't Equal Golang for 800, please.

**Mat Ryer:** He's going for the big scores... English duo Wham had a number one hit with this 1980s single jitterbug.

**Mark Bates:** What is "Wake me up before you go go"?

**Mat Ryer:** \[win sound\] \[laughter\]

**L Körbes:** I think this section of the game is unfairly beneficial to the geriatric demographic.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, they haven't got long left, have they?

**Mark Bates:** I'm only 44, people!

**L Körbes:** Exactly.

**Mat Ryer:** 44 people... Inside you you're worked by 44 different small people?

**L Körbes:** In a trench coat.

**Mark Bates:** Yes, in a trench coat. \[laughter\] There's 44 small people working on Bates' body.

**Mat Ryer:** Just doing programming, and-- \[laughter\] Nice. That's grotesque. Okay, it's Kat's turn now, I think. Was it just your turn, Mark?

**Kat Zień:** It is.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, Kat. Let's do it. Maybe get some higher scores.

**Kat Zień:** Yeah... Meh...

**Mat Ryer:** Come on, you can do it.

**Kat Zień:** Let's do GitHub Stars for 600.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. GitHub Stars. The tool for beautiful monitoring and metric analysis and dashboards for Graphite, InfluxDB, Prometheus and more.

**Kat Zień:** What is Grafana?

**Mat Ryer:** \[win sound\] 600 points! Check that out, you've just doubled your score. Nice one.

**Kat Zień:** Nice.

**Mark Bates:** Why was it Grafana/Grafana?

**Mat Ryer:** That's the GitHub repo name.

**Mark Bates:** Oh.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, L, time for you to pick a square.

**L Körbes:** Yeah, let's stick to the libraries, 600.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, Standard Librarians, 600. It contains operations that step around the type safety of Go programs.

**L Körbes:** I have an answer, but it might be a bit unsafe...

**Mat Ryer:** Ooh... Do you want to say it anyway?

**L Körbes:** Yeah, I already did. It's Unsafe.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Unsafe. Let's see. \[win sound\] Correct!

**L Körbes:** \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Nice one. You don't get any extra points for putting it in to a different sentence, unfortunately. I wish we had thought of that.

**L Körbes:** Meh...

**Mat Ryer:** You just get kudos points, and everyone thinks you're brill, so that's alright.

**L Körbes:** But they already do.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Oh, they do? Oh. Mr. Bates.

**Mark Bates:** Yeah, I will take Standard Librarians for 800.

**Mat Ryer:** Sure will. Wraps an IO reader or IO writer object, creating another object that provides buffering and some help for textural IO.

**Mark Bates:** What is Scanner?

**Mat Ryer:** \[fail sounds\] What package are we looking for? I'm afraid I can't give you that...

**Mark Bates:** Oh, Bufio...

**Mat Ryer:** Kat, would you like to steal?

**Kat Zień:** So we're looking for a standard library package...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Kat Zień:** No, I don't wanna steal, because I'm gonna mess it up. I have an idea, but...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. L?

**L Körbes:** Well, I'm a big risk-taker, so let's go with bufio.

**Mat Ryer:** Bufio, let's see... \[win sound\] Yes...

**L Körbes:** Thanks, Mark.

**Mat Ryer:** That was unfortunate, Mark.

**Mark Bates:** I mentioned it; I said it out loud... \[laughter\] I still argue that Scanner is actually the thing that wraps those things, but anyway.

**Mat Ryer:** That's true, but it's package names. Kat, it's your turn now. Pick a square, please.

**Kat Zień:** I'll go for -- let's continue the GitHub Stars for 800. Risk it.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, let's do it. An HTTP web framework written in Go, that features a Martini-like API, with much better performance. What package does that describe?

**Kat Zień:** A package, so this would be the gorilla/mux. What is gorilla/mux?

**Mat Ryer:** Good guess. Let's see. \[fail sound\] It's not correct, I'm afraid... L, do you wanna steal this one?

**L Körbes:** Well, I thought it was the one she said, so now I don't know.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. So you don't want to steal?

**L Körbes:** No.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Bates, do you wanna give a steal of this one?

**Mark Bates:** No... There are about a bazillion HTTP frameworks out there.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay.

**Kat Zień:** \{36:14\} All based on Martini. \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** The answer was Gin. That's the one we were looking for.

**Kat Zień:** Oh, yeah...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, no matter. Right. Who's next? I've forgotten.

**Kat Zień:** Ellen, I think...

**L Körbes:** Right.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, L, yes.

**L Körbes:** What is Gopherpedia again?

**Mat Ryer:** It's facts about real gophers, that we got from Wikipedia.

**L Körbes:** Oh... That's gonna be hard. You know what - I'm gonna stick to the library. Let's do 200.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Implements a doubly-linked list.

**L Körbes:** Oh, \[unintelligible 00:36:47.26\] Really? I don't know.

**Mat Ryer:** I don't know either... But it's one of them, ain't it? You're gonna have to guess.

**L Körbes:** I don't know, I have no idea.

**Mat Ryer:** \[fail sound\] Okay. Bates, do you want to steal this one?

**Mark Bates:** No...

**Mat Ryer:** No. Kat.

**Mark Bates:** Absolutely not.

**Kat Zień:** No...

**L Körbes:** Why do you put the most difficult one with the lowest number?

**Mark Bates:** Right...?! Like a thousand. This isn't a two hundred.

**Mat Ryer:** Let's see what the answer is. It's the container/list.

**L Körbes:** I literally never heard of this package before.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, I'm sorry.

**Mark Bates:** I've never heard of it either.

**Mat Ryer:** I'll just write that down here.

**Mark Bates:** Yeah, thank you.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Next up. \[laughter\] Mark, it's your turn.

**Mark Bates:** I'll take Go Doesn't Equal Golang for 400.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, let's have a look. This computer program acquired by Google plays the board game Go. It's a computer program acquired by Google, and it plays the board game Go.

**Mark Bates:** Yeah, you say that... Um...

**Mat Ryer:** I do say that... That is what I say.

**Mark Bates:** What is Steam? I have no idea.

**Mat Ryer:** \[fail sound\] Incorrect. Kat, would you like to steal this one?

**Kat Zień:** Nope.

**Mat Ryer:** There's a documentary about this on Netflix. Still don't wanna steal?

**Mark Bates:** I haven't seen it...

**Kat Zień:** No.

**Mat Ryer:** L, wanna steal it?

**L Körbes:** No, I don't watch TV, man. I don't know.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay... The answer was AlphaGo, which was DeepMind's AI that can beat humans now at the game Go. Very cool.

**L Körbes:** Yeah, humans suck.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah...

**Kat Zień:** Not hard to beat. \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Kat, would you like to pick a square, please?

**Kat Zień:** Yeah, I will go for -- let's go GitHub Stars, 400.

**Mat Ryer:** 400, okay. A curated listed of all-inspiring Go frameworks, libraries and software.

**Kat Zień:** What is Awesome Go?

**Mat Ryer:** Let's see... \[win sound\] 400 points winging their way to you right now.

**Kat Zień:** Nice...

**Mat Ryer:** Well done. L, what do you think?

**L Körbes:** I'll take the 200.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Go Doesn't Equal Golang, for 200. A type of small, four-wheeled vehicle, motorized or not, often used by kids.

**L Körbes:** It's a go-kart.

**Mat Ryer:** \[win sound.

**L Körbes:** Yay!

**Mat Ryer:** Correct. For 200 points. Nice one. Mr. Bates.

**Mark Bates:** Oh, boy...

**Mat Ryer:** It's getting tricky now, ain't it? Down to the last few squares...

**Mark Bates:** It is, yeah. And everybody's catching up on me too here. It's starting to get a bit close. I'm gonna go big. Let's go GitHub Stars for 1,000.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, let's have a look. A collaborative project for the container ecosystem to assemble container-based systems.

**Kat Zień:** That should have been a 200.

**L Körbes:** yeah.

**Mark Bates:** Well, yeah, it depends on the answer... I'm gonna say "What is Moby?"

**Mat Ryer:** \[win sound\] Correct. Well done. I don't think that was as easy as it seems...

**Mark Bates:** \{39:58\} Well, because you could have said Docker, which was at one point the correct answer, and then it moved... And that's why I was like, Moby.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, you got it right. Kat, what do you fancy?

**Kat Zień:** Let's go -- do I risk it or do I not? No, let's go with Gopherpedia for 400.

**Mat Ryer:** Gopherpedia, 400. Gophers are known to create a network of these for protection, and a means of collecting food.

**Kat Zień:** I don't know what the actual term is, but they're like the underground canals, or tunnels... I don't know what the name of that is.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, well let's take your answer "tunnels", and see if that's the correct answer. \[win sound\]

**Kat Zień:** Oh, nice.

**Mat Ryer:** Tunnels! Simple as that. See, we're not here to hurt people and make them feel bad... Unless it's Mark Bates. L, what's your choice?

**L Körbes:** Okay, so if the 200 on the standard library was really hard, then the 1,000 is probably really easy, right?

**Mark Bates:** It stands to reason...

**L Körbes:** Let's go with that, yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Let's see. Implements utility functions to help with black box testing.

**L Körbes:** Yeah, I don't know...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Do you wanna have a--

**L Körbes:** Mock?

**Mark Bates:** You're already just kicking it over to me? \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** No, L said Mock.

**Mark Bates:** Oh, Mock? I thought you said Mark.

**L Körbes:** Yeah...

**Mat Ryer:** \[fail sound\] Incorrect, I'm afraid. Mr. Bates, would you like to steal this one?

**Mark Bates:** Um... No.

**Mat Ryer:** Kat, would you like to steal it? I will say it, on this one, I don't get why this is the description for it. But I did happen to know this one. I didn't write these questions, by the way... But it's a tough one.

**Kat Zień:** I'm not gonna steal it, it's too risky. I have an idea, but... I'm not gonna risk it.

**Mark Bates:** Too many points, exactly.

**Mat Ryer:** What was your idea? We won't do the points, but just say it.

**Kat Zień:** So my idea was just simply Utils, or Util I think it is... But that's just like a trick question.

**Mat Ryer:** It was actually the Quick package. Testing/quick.

**Mark Bates:** Testing/quick, yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, that's what it says...

**L Körbes:** Never heard of it.

**Mark Bates:** It's a package I can never really get to work the way I expect it to work, to be honest.

**Mat Ryer:** Right... \[laughter\]

**Kat Zień:** Why is it called Quick? Because like quick to test?

**Mark Bates:** Yeah, but it's really hard to use...

**Mat Ryer:** Interesting.

**Kat Zień:** Okay...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Who's go is it now? I'm supposed to keep track of this.

**Mark Bates:** I think it's mine.

**Mat Ryer:** Yes, it is. Mr. Bates.

**Mark Bates:** I'm gonna go with Gopherpedia for 600.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, let's have a look. Pocket gophers get their name from this, their most characteristic feature.

**Mark Bates:** What is a front pouch?

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, what is a front pouch... \[fail sound\] Oh, it's not correct, I'm afraid. Kat, do you wanna steal this one?

**Kat Zień:** Nope...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay... L?

**L Körbes:** No idea.

**Mat Ryer:** Let's have a look... Large cheek. Pouches.

**Kat Zień:** Oh...

**Mark Bates:** Yeah, that's right. \[unintelligible 00:42:56.21\]

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Okay. Kat, let's finish this board off...

**Kat Zień:** Well, I'll just go with 800.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, let's have a look. Bill Murray plays a mentally unstable groundskeeper who hunts a pesky gopher in this 1980 golf comedy. Do you know this one?

**Kat Zień:** 1980s golf comedy... I wasn't born then. \[laughs\] I wasn't born yet.

**L Körbes:** This is a geriatric quiz.

**Mat Ryer:** Films still carry on through time... But you love golf comedies, so I'm surprised you --

**Kat Zień:** Yeah...

**Mat Ryer:** You're always going on about golf comedies.

**Kat Zień:** I don't know... I suck at movies.

**Mat Ryer:** \[fail sound\] Okay. L, would you like to steal it?

**L Körbes:** Nah... The only thing I can think about is Groundhog Day, but it's not that.

**Mat Ryer:** Right, yeah. Mr. Bates, you might know this one.

**Mark Bates:** Yes, I do. What is Caddyshack?

**Mat Ryer:** \[win sound\] Yes, you've stolen it. Okay. L, it's your turn for this last one... Goldy Gopher cheers alongside students at this American university.

**L Körbes:** \{44:11\} I barely understand the sentence. \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** I think it's a mascot. There's a mascot called Goldy Gopher.

**L Körbes:** Oh...

**Mark Bates:** So what university is it the mascot at.

**L Körbes:** Am I supposed to say like University of Alabama, or something?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, you are supposed to say something like that, yeah.

**L Körbes:** Okay, then let's do the math... Where is it that there are gophers? I'm guessing it's like up North...

**Mat Ryer:** Pretty good, yeah...

**L Körbes:** So what's a Northern university... Is Colorado in the North? There was a GopherCon there. Maybe that's relevant. I don't know.

**Mark Bates:** No, that's out West. That's \[unintelligible 00:44:46.01\]

**L Körbes:** Right... So what's North? Minnesota is North, but are there gophers? It's so cold there... I don't know. University of Michigan? I don't know.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, you need to pick one of those. You have said the right answer, so you just have to pick one of them.

**L Körbes:** I have? Okay, let's go with -- okay, Alabama is a swamp, so it can't be there, I think. I'm bad at geography. Colorado could be... And the other two... Okay, let's go with Colorado. University of Colorado.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. \[fail sound\] I'm sorry, that's incorrect. Mr. Bates, do you know this one?

**Mark Bates:** I do not.

**Mat Ryer:** Would you like to steal it, take a guess?

**Mark Bates:** Clearly not. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Kat, do you wanna steal it?

**Kat Zień:** If I steal it, do I get minus points for getting it wrong?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, I'm afraid so.

**Kat Zień:** Oh, I don't know... I can't afford it.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Well, you can go into debt, as L has very clearly demonstrated...

**Kat Zień:** But this is my chance to not go into debt... \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Let's see the answer then, please. The answer is Minnesota.

**L Körbes:** Gosh darn it.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, very close. Gosh darn it as well, they say that there. Gosh darn it... That's how they talk.

**Mark Bates:** That's their school logo.

**Mat Ryer:** \[laughs\] Goldy Gopher.

**Mark Bates:** "Here's the University of Minnesota, Gosh darn it!" \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Well, that's the end of round two... Let's check out the scores and see where we get to. Trailing behind with -200 - it's only L. In second place we've got Kat, with 400, but Bates is definitely taking this game... He has 3,100.

**L Körbes:** He's a big liar, Bates... Because he promised us he was gonna lose.

**Mark Bates:** Mat's been texting me the answers on the back. I don't know if that's legal or not...

**L Körbes:** I mean, what's not legal is that all the questions are geared towards people past a certain, you know, length of existence...

**Mark Bates:** Length of existence... \[laughter\] Can I help it if Mat asked me to write all the questions for the game show? Oops... Nevermind.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Well, don't worry, it's all still to play for... Maybe.

**Mark Bates:** I feel like there's a lot of ageism, by the way, happening here. You know, just saying; being attacked.

**L Körbes:** You mean on part of the people who wrote the questions, right? \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** Yeah, exactly...

**Break:** \{47:16\}

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, we're gonna go into our final round... This one's different. What's gonna happen is we're gonna show you a category; here's the category, it's Local Host. And there's gonna be one question. You can bet/wager as much as you like. And actually, to make things a little bit more interesting, we're gonna add 700 to everyone's score. So we're gonna bring L up to 500, and we're gonna add 700 for Kat, and we're gonna add 700 for Bates.

**Mark Bates:** And I assume you can only bet up to the amount of points you actually have...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. So there we go. The category is Local Host. I don't know what this question even is, so it's just up to you to take a stab. What do you think? Kat, how much do you wanna wager?

**Kat Zień:** I don't know... 300? I'll go for 300.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. L?

**L Körbes:** All of it.

**Mat Ryer:** 500. Mr. Bates?

**Mark Bates:** 100.

**Mat Ryer:** And you're gonna send your answers privately on Zoom to me. And you're gonna do that now, while this music plays.

**Mark Bates:** We get a question at least, or just the category?

**Mat Ryer:** Good point. Okay... Selling literally dozens of copies, this 2015 book was written by none other than your Go Panic host, Mat Ryer. So that's me. I didn't write this question.

**Jingle:** \{50:43\}

**Mat Ryer:** This music will help you think.

**L Körbes:** Wait, what's going on with the music...?

**Mat Ryer:** It's like an anxiety dream.

**Mark Bates:** I know. That was supposed to help us think, but my anxiety went through the roof.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah... In the beginning it helps you think, and then if you haven't made your minds up, then it's just chaos.

**Mark Bates:** I'll have to double down on my Zoloft after that...

**Mat Ryer:** \[laughs\] I don't know what that is, but it sounds like it's good.

**L Körbes:** It's medicine.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. So I'm gonna read out the answers then... Or let's find out what the real answer is. My book is called "Go Programming Blueprints", and it is available still.

**L Körbes:** I almost got it...!

**Mat Ryer:** So Mark, you said "Go Programming Blue prints." Blue and print is two words, but that's fine; you can still have it.

**Mark Bates:** Thank you. You're too kind.

**Mat Ryer:** Kat --

**Kat Zień:** I thought you had five different variations... \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** You got it right, "Go Programming Blueprints." And L, you said "Go Design Patterns", which is --

**L Körbes:** I mean, it's the same idea...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, but it is...

**Mark Bates:** It is not. \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** ...a different title. Yeah. So L, you're down to zero, I'm afraid... Kat, that paid off for you. You have 1,400. But the winner of the Raspberry Pi 400, with 4,000 points - it's Mr. Mark Bates.

**Mark Bates:** \{52:26\} Thank you, thank you. Thank you very much.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, he's such an annoying winner...

**L Körbes:** So Mark, what are you gonna do with the prize?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, what are you gonna do with the Raspberry Pi 400?

**Mark Bates:** I don't know, I'm gonna have to get a monitor, I guess, to go with it... \[laughs\]

**Kat Zień:** A server for electricity.

**Mark Bates:** And electricity, and the key caps... I'm very excited. Very excited.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. But it's cool.

**L Körbes:** Also a mouse.

**Mark Bates:** And a mouse...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Unless you just use Vim. Maybe you could just use Vim on it and have it read out... You know what I mean? Like, make it speak to you instead. I don't know. Would that work?

**Mark Bates:** Just read code. Yeah, that always works so well...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. It'd be fun though, wouldn't it? Did you have a good time during the quiz then?

**Kat Zień:** It was fun. I was hoping there'd be more questions. Weren't there more questions in the final round?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, we're running out of time unfortunately, so that's just the way it is...

**L Körbes:** I was expecting to be able to make fun of Mat, but he wasn't playing, so that didn't work out...

**Mat Ryer:** It's hard to make fun of me, mate.

**L Körbes:** No, it's not.

**Mark Bates:** That's not true at all...

**Mat Ryer:** Go on, then. Let's do a quick insult.

**Kat Zień:** It'd be so fun if Mat was playing and we had a question about the book that Mat Ryer wrote, and you got it wrong... That'd be so funny. \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** Mat, next time might I recommend renting some chest hair for under your shirt, if you're gonna open it up that much...

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, it's not open far, is it? Would you rather like that, like some Puritan?

**Mark Bates:** Well, far enough to know that you need to rent chest hair next time...

**Mat Ryer:** \[laughs\] Where do you rent chest hair from?

**Mark Bates:** I don't know...

**Kat Zień:** The wig shop?

**Mark Bates:** ...the Burt Reynolds Museum? \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Can you just use a wig? Surely it has to be dedicated. You can't just do that...

**Kat Zień:** Well, you know how some men just get the patch; you can get a patch of hair for the top and just glue it here.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. If I'm going to a wig shop, I'm gonna wear a wig.

**Mark Bates:** Why don't you have them do you top to bottom? I mean... \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. \[unintelligible 00:54:31.15\]

**Mark Bates:** Just go in there and say "I want the works. Top to bottom, I want hair."

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. I'd love that. And then they'd just set to work with the Pritt stick, sticking it all on.

**Mark Bates:** Exactly. It'll be like that scene in Wizard of Oz, where they're buffin' up the Tin Man, and they're stuffin' the Scarecrow with \[unintelligible 00:54:51.28\] and everything.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. I'd love that, mate. I'd love that. I'd be a sort of character... But not, I have a receding -- but I like to say what I like in hair, I more than make up for it in forehead. \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** That is true.

**Mat Ryer:** I see people, like -- L, you've got loads of hair. Bates, you've got loads. So have you, Kat. And I feel like we should have some socialism, like your hairs should be taxed. People that just have loads of hair - that should be taxed, and then I get some. Do you know what I mean? Because it's not fair. What do you think?

**Mark Bates:** I'll send you some in the Post, next time I cut my hair.

**L Körbes:** But then is it only for hair on your head, or is it hair general?

**Mark Bates:** Gotta go... \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Yes, we're not gonna answer that one...

**Mark Bates:** We're on the verge of a COC violation there.

**Mat Ryer:** Mm-hm. I'm pleased you didn't pronounce that, Mark, like you normally do.

**Kat Zień:** Well, on the plus side, Mat, think of all the shampoo money that you get to save on.

**Mat Ryer:** I'm absolutely loaded because I don't need any shampoo.

**Kat Zień:** I bet you are.

**Mat Ryer:** I just use a tiny bit.

**Mark Bates:** Yeah, but he has to double down on the Turtle Wax to keep that thing shiny...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. And that's more expensive, so I am net down, basically, in the end, once I do my books at the end of the month... \[laughter\] I find that I've wasted it. Yeah, I don't know...

\{56:19\} Well, that's why I like the Go community, because it's so all-accepting, and everyone's welcoming, and things... So it's okay if you do have a forehead like this; or as my cousin called it, a fivehead.

**Mark Bates:** Or if you're incredibly old and geriatric, like I am...

**Mat Ryer:** But you do get good quizzes if you've been around longer. You do get good at quizzes, don't you?

**Mark Bates:** Yeah, you do.

**Mat Ryer:** Some of the questions I think I agree... I think we need some more diversity on the question panel of who writes the questions.

**L Körbes:** I was part of a pop quiz team once, and the questions were all like "Who won the tennis championship in 1976?" and I was like "Dude, my mom is too young to know that." \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, but the information is available after that though... You know what I mean?

**Mark Bates:** You don't have to have lived through it, yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Because I do Beatles questions sometimes. I get them right, because --

**Mark Bates:** He just sits around the house and asks himself Beatles questions \[unintelligible 00:57:19.13\] \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** That's how you practice.

**L Körbes:** It sounds like a fun hobby.

**Mat Ryer:** But what I mean is -- you know, I think John Lennon had died before I was even born, but... Yeah, you can still learn the information.

**L Körbes:** Rest in peace, John Lennon.

**Mark Bates:** But are you all that young, really? Am I the only person who was alive when John Lennon was killed?

**L Körbes:** Yeah...

**Mark Bates:** I hate you all. Is this show over yet? I've gotta go yell at the sky and tell some people to get off my lawn. \[laughter\]

**L Körbes:** You have a lawn? Wow.

**Mark Bates:** I do. And I do yell at the neighbor kids for not shutting the gate to my backyard all the time.

**Mat Ryer:** Why are they even in your backgarden? That's the worrying thing.

**Mark Bates:** Because we have the nicest yard in the neighborhood. It's big and it's flat... We live in a city, so you can play soccer in my backyard. It's a nice, big field, so...

**Mat Ryer:** Right... Nice.

**Mark Bates:** But we also have a dog that escapes, so the dog gets out if they don't shut the gate. I am Grumpy Old Man Bates. "Shut the damn gate...!!"

**Mat Ryer:** Your name, to me, Mark, sounds like an incomplete sentence. I feel like there should be more to it. It's like a cliffhanger. "Mark Bates... What?! What does he bate?" I just always wanna know. Cliffhanger name.

**Mark Bates:** Thanks. Yeah... Of all the things you can make fun of my name for, that was probably the worst.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, yeah. Well, I'd rather be original than obvious... You know, as one of the proverbs says.

**Mark Bates:** Well, the good news is you're neither.

**Mat Ryer:** Is that good news? It doesn't feel like good news. It hurts my tummy when you tell me that.

**Mark Bates:** Fair enough. \[laughter\] A grumble in the bumble. Are we still doing a show?

**Mat Ryer:** We're still doing it, but we're about to finish. I'm just kind of -- we're hanging out, and then our time's about to... We're gonna be told momentarily that we're off... But we're not, we're still on air. This is the sort of post-show hangout.

**L Körbes:** You know, this is kind of what's lacking in online conferences, usually. It's like that time after the serious stuff is done, when we just make fun of each other's names and foreheads... That's what it's all about. \[laughter\]

**Kat Zień:** The corridor hangs...

**L Körbes:** Yeah...

**Mark Bates:** Or the late-night hotel room hangs...

**Kat Zień:** Yeah... The late-night whiskeys.

**L Körbes:** It's hard to remember those though...

**Mark Bates:** It's true, but I do so enjoy them. I'm missing all of you at the conference; I'm missing everybody.

**L Körbes:** Yeah.

**Mark Bates:** It's been a tough year... I think I can speak for everybody - we all have friends at these conferences, and you get to see everybody... I really miss it.

**Mat Ryer:** That's true, that's true.

**Kat Zień:** It was nice to take a break from the traveling for a while. And it's like "Oh yeah, it's nice. I can rest."

**Mark Bates:** Oh, I don't miss the travel. I'm 100% with you on that.

**Kat Zień:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the travel is not what you miss, but you do miss -- I don't even miss the talks that much, because the talks you can watch online anyway. But I just miss the genuine bumping into people on the corridor, seeing people that you normally don't see, and you only see them at conferences...

**Mat Ryer:** Well, hopefully next year is the time for it. I will have to say, thank you so much for joining Go Panic, this crazy quiz... Thank you very much to Kat, L and Mark, and we'll see you next time.
