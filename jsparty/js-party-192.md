**Jerod Santo:** Hello there, and welcome to Frontend Feud. I am Jerod Santo, your host for today. It has been a while since we played this game, but we are happy to be here today, and we have a podcast super-colab. We got together some of our friends from some of our favorite web dev podcasts in the space; I'm sure you've heard of them. It is gonna be Team Syntax versus Team ShopTalk. Hey, everybody. Welcome to Frontend Feud!

**Dave Rupert:** Heyy!!

**Scott Tolinski:** Yaayy!! \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Now, we wanted to give it a little JS Party flavor, so we've sprinkled in some JS Party panelists onto each team... So joining Team ShopTalk, which is Chris Coyier and Dave Rupert, is Amelia Wattenberger. So Amelia, you are on Team ShopTalk. What do you think?

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I love it. We're gonna win.

**Chris Coyier:** Oh, absolutely.

**Dave Rupert:** Good answer... Good answer... Good Answer...

**Wes Bos:** No chance!

**Jerod Santo:** And joining Team Syntax, which is Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski is Divya. Divya, welcome to Syntax.

**Divya:** Hey-hey! Best team!

**Wes Bos:** Best team!

**Jerod Santo:** Divya is an old pro at Frontend Feud, but I believe the rest of us are all new, even Amelia, so we should have a lot of fun. I'll quickly explain the rules. So this is a game all about the JS Party lovely listeners. We had 140 people fill out our Frontend Feud survey. We appreciate y'all for doing that. I really appreciate you, because I went back to the form at the end and realized the average take time was 37 minutes. I am so sorry. That thing took forever. And that's because we asked 25 questions, so we can play the game a few times, without having to go back and do more surveys. So I super-appreciate all of y'all for filling those out.

\{04:22\} The goal of the game is to match our listeners' answers. So we have polled them on different things, and each team is gonna try to match the answer with the most answers from the survey. And as you go about doing that, you win points. If you fail to do that three times in a round, the other team can steal, and the team with the most points at the end of the game wins. Any questions?

**Chris Coyier:** It's not the most correct answer, right? I used to play Apples to Apples with my super-pedantic uncle, and he was always like "But my answer is more correct" and you're like "Dennis! It's not about correctness!" \[laughter\]

**Wes Bos:** Oh, that's such a Dennis move. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Exactly, right. In fact, many of our questions are subjective, so it's according to people's tastes, and what they think. So there really aren't right answers. The right answers are the ones that the most people said. So we will start off with a face-off; this is where two contestants step forward virtually and get a chance to answer first. The person who gets the highest answer on the board takes that board for their team, and their team participates in that round.

Ladies first, we'll have Amelia and Divya, please step right up. Round one will start with Amelia. Amelia, if you get the highest answer, you immediately take the board. If you don't take the highest answer, Divya gets a chance to take it. We asked 140 lovely JS Party listeners "What is your primary web browser?"

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Oh, no pressure... I'm gonna go with Chrome.

**Dave Rupert:** Good answer, good answer, good answer, good answer.

**Jerod Santo:** Number one answer, with 52 responses... So that means Team ShopTalk is on the board.

**Chris Coyier:** ALRIGHT!

**Jerod Santo:** So we will now go in order. You can keep guessing. There are six browsers in the list, so you have to match all six to take the board.

**Chris Coyier:** What...!?

**Divya:** Oooh...

**Jerod Santo:** You have the number one answer, which is Chrome, with 52. There's five left. Let's go to Chris.

**Chris Coyier:** Firefox.

**Jerod Santo:** Firefox. Show me Firefox. Number two answer, with 43 points. Very good.

**Chris Coyier:** There's no conferring? Who goes next? Me?

**Jerod Santo:** There's no conferring. Now we go to Dave. So we're going around. Dave, it's your turn.

**Dave Rupert:** It gets infinitely harder from here on out... I'll go with Edge.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me Edge. Number four answer, with 11 points. Edge is on there, so you have three of the six. Now we go back to Amelia.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I literally do not know any other browsers. I don't wanna say Internet Explorer...

**Jerod Santo:** Is that your answer?

**Amelia Wattenberger:** It is not. \[laughter\] My answer is gonna be better than that.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay... So what is your answer then?

**Divya:** You got it!

**Amelia Wattenberger:** No, it's gonna be Internet Explorer.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, show me IE. \[fail sound\]

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Sorry...

**Jerod Santo:** I'm sorry, that's your first strike.

**Chris Coyier:** It's all good.

**Dave Rupert:** That's okay, because that could have been like a total troll answer. I feel like that was fully valid, yeah.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Yeah, I was trolling.

**Divya:** For all the testers out there using IE...

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah.

**Divya:** Gotta represent.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, we go to Chris.

**Chris Coyier:** So do we keep it, because strikes? Yeah, okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Yup. So you have one strike. You have two strikes left, and then there'll be a steal opportunity.

**Chris Coyier:** I'm gonna go with Safari, because it feels like one of the big three.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me Safari. Number five answer, with eight respondents using Safari.

**Chris Coyier:** Oh, so number three is still available?

**Jerod Santo:** Remember, it's their primary browser. Okay, so now we go back to Dave.

**Chris Coyier:** We've got this.

**Dave Rupert:** Oh, boy... I'm gonna go Brave.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me Brave. Number three answer, there it was. Number three. Eighteen people out there using Brave as their primary.

**Dave Rupert:** Wow, number three?!

**Jerod Santo:** \{08:05\} So we have one strike against you. You have Chrome at number one, Firefox at two, Brave at three... We also said Safari at five. Did you say the number four? You did, you said Edge, at number four. So there's one left.

**Chris Coyier:** That's nuts.

**Jerod Santo:** And we're back to Amelia. You have two strikes... So just take a guess.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** There's that one where it has -- oh, I'm not gonna give any clues. I don't actually know the name.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Do you wanna guess something random, or do you wanna just take a strike?

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I use one called Stack, that I know no one else uses...

**Jerod Santo:** Show me Stack. \[fail sound\] You were correct, nobody else uses Stack... \[laughter\]

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Dang it.

**Chris Coyier:** So are we gonna get a point for that? She was correct...

**Jerod Santo:** She was correct, nobody uses it... So we go to Chris now. This is your last guess before team Syntax gets to steal.

**Wes Bos:** Oh, we're gonna steal it.

**Chris Coyier:** I've gotta go with the big O, Opera. I know it's a wild card, but I just feel like it might be hanging on.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me Opera. \[fail sound\]

**Chris Coyier:** Whow...!

**Jerod Santo:** Three strikes and you're out. So Team Syntax gets one guess. You can confer amongst the team. And if you get it right, you steal the board.

**Divya:** Okay. Can we confer openly?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Divya:** Samsung.

**Wes Bos:** I was gonna say... Vidalvi?

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah, maybe. Vivaldi.

**Divya:** Vivaldi?

**Wes Bos:** Vidalvi? Isn't that what it is?

**Divya:** Vivaldi.

**Wes Bos:** I'm just naming browsers here, yeah.

**Divya:** I thought it was Samsung, because they have a bunch of developer advocates in this stuff. And also, you use it when you use your phone, right? So...

**Wes Bos:** They don't have a desktop browser though, do they?

**Divya:** No, I think it's only mobile. I think it's just like a mobile thing, which is why I'm like "Is it...?" I don't know...

**Jerod Santo:** What's Vivaldi?

**Scott Tolinski:** Vivaldi. V-I-V-A-L-D-I.

**Jerod Santo:** What is it?

**Divya:** We can't google it, so I can't tell you.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, that's true. Okay, so you're thinking Samsung, you're thinking Vivaldi...

**Divya:** Vivaldi is also a famous person.

**Wes Bos:** I think Vivaldi is like a -- wasn't it like a security-focused browser? So I could see there being one...

**Divya:** Or Tor, actually, which is also another--

**Wes Bos:** Can you use that as a --

**Scott Tolinski:** Man, this is tough...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, let's make a decision here... What are you guys thinking?

**Scott Tolinski:** Okay.

**Wes Bos:** I think we should go -- what do you think, Scott?

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, I have no idea. In terms of browsers that I just heard mentioned recently, Vivaldi was one of them, so that's why I --

**Divya:** Yeah, that sounds fine, I guess...

**Scott Tolinski:** I don't know though. I have no idea. Samsung could definitely be it, too.

**Wes Bos:** I've seen it on Hacker News a few times, which is why I wanna go with that.

**Divya:** Are JS Party listeners Orange folk, too?

**Wes Bos:** I don't know... There's gotta be one...

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** It's a good question.

**Divya:** There has to be one, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, pick one. Let's move on. What have you got?

**Wes Bos:** Vivaldi.

**Jerod Santo:** Vivaldi. Is that number five? Show me Vivaldi... \[win sound\]

**Wes Bos:** Yeah!!

**Divya:** Yeey!!

**Wes Bos:** I told you! Yes!

**Jerod Santo:** Five JS Party listeners...

**Wes Bos:** Five?!

**Scott Tolinski:** Five people use Vivaldi?!

**Divya:** That's crazy.

**Jerod Santo:** Five out of 140, yeah.

**Divya:** Who builds Vivaldi?

**Chris Coyier:** Do they get all the points for the entire round?

**Jerod Santo:** They stole 137 points on that.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Wait, we made those points!

**Wes Bos:** Well, anybody can guess the other browsers... \[laughter\]

**Dave Rupert:** I went out on a limb with Edge, I felt like...

**Scott Tolinski:** It was the third one I wrote down when I was writing down browsers here...

**Jerod Santo:** There you go.

**Divya:** Amazing.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. So after round one we have Team Syntax with a steal, 137 to nothing. There's lots of game left to play, so we now go to round two, a face-off between Chris and Scott.

**Scott Tolinski:** I hope it's about browsers again.

**Jerod Santo:** So we gave Amelia the first guess last round, so we're gonna give Scott the first guess...

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, no...

**Jerod Santo:** If you don't hit number one, then Chris will have a chance.

**Scott Tolinski:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** We asked 140 of our fascinating JS Party listeners "Name a tool or technology that you use, but don't fully understand."

**Scott Tolinski:** Use, but don't understand... I am going to say it is -- I have a lot of options here. \[laughter\] Let's just say... Let's say WebPack.

**Wes Bos:** \{12:19\} That's a good answer.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me WebPack. Number one answer.

**Scott Tolinski:** I knew it! Hold it, I haven't closed my door. My wife texted me "What's going on?!" \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** He's having too much fun. Alright, so with that, Scott takes the round, and team syntax will play. Now, there's five answers on the board, of which you have taken the number one answer, so there's four left... And we go now to Divya.

**Divya:** So this is frontend frameworks people don't understand?

**Jerod Santo:** Let me read it again. "Name a tool or technology that you use, but don't fully understand."

**Divya:** Hm... A tool or technology that people use, that they don't understand... Oh, man. This is a very open-ended question.

**Jerod Santo:** You know, like WebPack...

**Divya:** Like WebPack, yes.

**Wes Bos:** I'm so impressed that you got that, Scott.

**Scott Tolinski:** I have a lot of options here.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Divya, we need an answer...

**Divya:** I wanna say... What's another tool that's similar to WebPack? Oh, SnowPack.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me SnowPack. \[fail sound\]

**Wes Bos:** Aww...

**Divya:** Not enough users of SnowPack.

**Jerod Santo:** Sorry, SnowPack was not on the list. Okay, Wes, we go to you.

**Wes Bos:** Redux.

**Scott Tolinski:** Good guess.

**Jerod Santo:** I like that one, but did it make the list? \[fail sound\]

**Scott Tolinski:** What?!

**Divya:** What?! I guess everyone knows Redux...

**Scott Tolinski:** That was almost one of my number ones here...

**Jerod Santo:** We've got two strikes and you still have four answers left on the board. We go back to Scott now.

**Scott Tolinski:** Docker.

**Wes Bos:** Oh, that's a good one.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me Docker. Number two answer, Docker, with 12 responses.

**Divya:** Oh, man... Alright, I guess I've gotta go to CI/CD now... \[laughter\] Kubernetes... This is probably wrong.

**Jerod Santo:** I grouped that with Docker, because there were people answering both. So those are together, Docker and Kubernetes.

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, I had Kubernetes on my list here.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Divya:** They're very different tools, I will say...

**Jerod Santo:** I know they are. But people were mixing and matching them, so please pick another one.

**Divya:** Let's see...

**Scott Tolinski:** I can't believe Redux wasn't there...

**Divya:** Can I just say CI, or does it have to be a tool?

**Jerod Santo:** A tool or technology.

**Divya:** Is CI a technology, technically?

**Jerod Santo:** I think so...

**Divya:** It's a concept?

**Jerod Santo:** I think it is...

**Divya:** CI/CD.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Show me CI/CD. \[fail sound\]

**Wes Bos:** Aww...

**Dave Rupert:** That's surprising, actually...

**Wes Bos:** There's no way they'll steal this. That's okay, no sweat.

**Divya:** There's no way everyone understands CI/CD.

**Jerod Santo:** But maybe they don't use it. It's a technology that you use, but don't fully understand.

**Scott Tolinski:** Maybe they don't think about it.

**Divya:** Come on! Deployments...?

**Jerod Santo:** Maybe they do, maybe they don't. Alright, Team ShopTalk can confer on a chance to steal.

**Chris Coyier:** Okay, we've got a couple of possible options...

**Jerod Santo:** You've got three possibilities here.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I'm \[unintelligible 00:15:07.24\]

**Chris Coyier:** I feel like the troll answer is to just say CSS, because people like to be like "I don't understand..."

**Dave Rupert:** Okay, okay, yeah...

**Divya:** Okay...

**Chris Coyier:** And then the one that you probably actually don't understand is Git.

**Wes Bos:** Oh, that's for sure on there...

**Divya:** Oh, man...

**Chris Coyier:** But those are just ideas, you know...

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I had Git, too. I also have Bash...

**Chris Coyier:** JavScript is a troll answer, too...

**Dave Rupert:** Bash, okay...

**Amelia Wattenberger:** JavScript is good, Bash... And Babel, which I don't know about.

**Divya:** Oh, I just thought of one...!

**Amelia Wattenberger:** You can say it... \[laughter\]

**Divya:** No, I'm not saying it. I'm gonna message Wes.

**Dave Rupert:** I had serverless, and stuff like that, but... You know, I think I like Git, or... Yeah...

**Chris Coyier:** What do you think, Amelia?

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I like Git.

**Chris Coyier:** \{15:58\} Okay, we're gonna go with Git.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. For the steal, show me Git. \[win sound\]

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah! Big steal!

**Chris Coyier:** It's a game of steals.

**Jerod Santo:** That's the number four answer, with eight respondents saying Git.

**Chris Coyier:** Interesting. So there's a missing three.

**Jerod Santo:** Number three was React... And number five was Npm.

**Chris Coyier:** Fair enough...

**Jerod Santo:** A couple of honorable mentions...

**Divya:** I'm actually surprised no one said Regex.

**Chris Coyier:** Oh, that would have been good.

**Divya:** That's a good one. Just thought about it.

**Wes Bos:** Or Redis...

**Scott Tolinski:** Tools that make me fall asleep.

**Chris Coyier:** But if you don't know it, maybe you just don't use it...

**Divya:** Maybe, yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** Chris, four people said CSS. It just barely missed the board. Three people said Node, two people said "Dependency injection", which I think you should know how it works before you use that one... And one person said PHP, and then in parentheses they said "I don't think anyone will ever fully understand PHP." \[laughter\] Okay, so some commentary there...

**Chris Coyier:** Install WordPress...

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah, just use WordPress.

**Chris Coyier:** Cool. That was fun.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, so let me add these up here. So nice steal...

**Divya:** Cool...

**Jerod Santo:** And that is--

**Chris Coyier:** Was it one to one? Is that how it works?

**Wes Bos:** No, we're still winning, by far.

**Jerod Santo:** It's points-based, but I'll tell you, the last rounds the points double, so there's usually a chance to come back near the end... Okay, so you've stolen 63; there were 63 points available that round. So currently, Syntax is still in the lead, 137 to 63. But everyone's playing quite well, quite within reach...

**Divya:** Nice!

**Break**: \{17:26\}

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, let's move to round three, which is gonna be Dave versus Wes. Now, Team Syntax got to guess first last round, so we'll go to Dave for the first guess. We asked 140 brilliant JS Party listeners "What's something you do to reach a state of dev flow?" Yes, Dave.

**Dave Rupert:** Music. Do I need to be more specific? Like, electronic music...

**Jerod Santo:** Music is just fine. Show me music. Number one answer. 66 people say they listen to music. They also had a bunch of different kinds of genres and stuff, but I just combined them all together. So that's team ShopTalk, you guys get to play this round. You already have the number one answer. There are five total answers, four left on the board...

**Chris Coyier:** Freakin' A.

**Jerod Santo:** And we go to Amelia. What's something people do to reach a state of dev flow?

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I drink a lot of coffee.

**Chris Coyier:** Totally on there.

**Dave Rupert:** Good answer, good answer, good answer...

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "Drink coffee." Number four answer, good job.

**Scott Tolinski:** \{20:07\} Wow, four...

**Jerod Santo:** That's generally drinking things. Drink coffee, people said drink tea, drink energy drinks... That's worth nine points, so good one. And now it is Chris' turn.

**Chris Coyier:** I am just dying here... Dev flow. What do you do, that's like a common thing that you do...? Is there something like move locations? Is that too vague? Like, go to a coffee shop?

**Jerod Santo:** Somewhat vague.

**Chris Coyier:** Somewhat vague. Um, shut the door.

**Jerod Santo:** Shut the door. Show me "Shut the door." \[win alert\] I will give it to you.

**Divya:** Wow, nice...!

**Jerod Santo:** This is a category of things where people said "Remove distractions, go to DND, close the door..." Have a quiet place, some people were saying. So I'll give you that one.

**Divya:** I feel like Wes clued them in when he closed the door... \[laughter\] It definitely helped.

**Wes Bos:** I'm sinking my own ship here.

**Jerod Santo:** Wes is really in dev flow right now. So that was 26 points. That's the number two answer. So you have one, two and four. So three and five are still on the board, and that puts us back to Dave.

**Dave Rupert:** Oh, boy. Blocking time on your calendar?

**Jerod Santo:** That was part of the remove distractions one, yeah.

**Dave Rupert:** Well, I need a new one... And the next one is not good. \[laughter\] Let's see... You've gotta have your hot chip. Snacks.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] I was like, "What's Hot Chip?" Um... Show me snacks. \[fail sound\]

**Dave Rupert:** Nah...!

**Jerod Santo:** That's your first miss. So you're doing well, you have two misses left... And it is now Amelia's turn. Amelia, what's something you do to reach the state of dev flow?

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I definitely eat hot chips... \[laughter\]

**Dave Rupert:** Hot chip. \[unintelligible 00:22:01.10\]

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I guess if not that, you wanted Chris to be more clear about his going to places thing, so I'm gonna go with a specific place, which is going to your desk. I don't like that face.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "Going to your desk." \[laughter\] Maybe just a little bit too on the nose... But a good effort. We go back to Chris.

**Chris Coyier:** It sounds like none of these are related to technology. None of them is like "Troll around for cool VS Code extensions", or whatever. \[unintelligible 00:22:38.27\]

**Scott Tolinski:** "Go on Twitter."

**Jerod Santo:** Is that how you get in flow? Installing plugins? \[laughs\]

**Chris Coyier:** Twitter is the exact opposite of flow...

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah, I know how to get out of flow. Can we do that one? \[laughter\] Like, YouTube...

**Chris Coyier:** Yeah... I'm gonna go with "Put on sweatpants."

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah, good answer, good answer, good answer...

**Jerod Santo:** Good answer, good answer... I'm going to give you that one.

**Divya:** Nice!

**Jerod Santo:** This is a combination of "Prepare yourself." So there was like "Get the room set up, good posture, sleep first, put on certain clothes..." People said "Put on comfy clothes", so that's why I'm giving it to you. So that's ten points, which means there's one left. Number five is still out there, and you have one strike left... And Dave has a chance at it. Go ahead, Dave.

**Dave Rupert:** Okay, so recap - we've done music, we've done get comfy, we've done...

**Jerod Santo:** Remove distractions...

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Coffee...

**Dave Rupert:** Remove distractions, we've done coffee... And there's one more?

**Jerod Santo:** There is one more.

**Dave Rupert:** Turn off email? That's in distractions.

**Jerod Santo:** That's remove distractions, yup.

**Dave Rupert:** Oh, boy...

**Chris Coyier:** So sorry, Dave...

**Jerod Santo:** It's tough.

**Dave Rupert:** Go for a walk?

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "Go for a walk." \[fail sound\]

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh... That was on my list.

**Divya:** Oh, man...

**Wes Bos:** Alright, we get to steal.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, chance to steal. I tell you, this is a tough one, so you've got your work cut out for you.

**Wes Bos:** Alright, guys, what are you thinking?

**Scott Tolinski:** I had "Put on headphones", or something...

**Divya:** Yeah.

**Wes Bos:** Yeah. I was gonna say, noise-cancelling headphones, white noise...

**Scott Tolinski:** \{24:10\} White noise, yeah...

**Wes Bos:** Exercise...

**Divya:** Meditate...

**Wes Bos:** Meditate. I had meditate.

**Scott Tolinski:** Somebody did say "Go for a walk", which could be constituted as exercise maybe, so...

**Divya:** yeah...

**Wes Bos:** Meditate, or noise-cancelling headphones.

**Divya:** Wait, was noise-cancelling headphones "removing distractions" though? Is that part of the whole umbrella?

**Wes Bos:** Yeah...

**Scott Tolinski:** I had that as my very first one on the list.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I'm gonna say that's part of removing distractions, because it's kind of like "Get quiet."

**Scott Tolinski:** Okay.

**Wes Bos:** So we've got white noise... I have full-screen, which is probably also "remove distractions".

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah...

**Wes Bos:** Blocker apps, that's part of it...

**Scott Tolinski:** Blocker apps, remove distractions.

**Wes Bos:** Meditate, white noise...

**Scott Tolinski:** What do people do to focus?

**Divya:** I'm trying to think of all the Tim Ferriss productivity hacks... Morning routine...! \[laughter\]

**Scott Tolinski:** I have a "go to coffee shop" as one of my things on my list, which is going somewhere...

**Divya:** Oh, you mean like working at the coffee shop?

**Scott Tolinski:** Just going to the coffee shop, because that's what I do when I really can't focus...

**Wes Bos:** I think that's under coffee.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, that one was kind of broached, I think both with your environment, and there was "Drink coffee", so...

**Scott Tolinski:** Gotcha.

**Wes Bos:** I think meditate.

**Divya:** Maybe meditate, yeah.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah. I don't have anything else.

**Wes Bos:** Let's just Hail Marry it.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "Meditate." \[fail sound\]

**Divya:** Oh, man...

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I thought that was it.

**Jerod Santo:** Meditate didn't make the list.

**Dave Rupert:** Good for us!

**Chris Coyier:** What happens now?!

**Dave Rupert:** But I also -- I have no idea, I wouldn't know that answer.

**Jerod Santo:** This one - I would not have guessed this... Five people said they listen to podcasts. Here we all are, on a podcast...

**Scott Tolinski:** I do that, yeah.

**Dave Rupert:** That's kind of refreshing, that at least five people listen to podcasts. That's great. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** And one specifically said "Listen to the JS Party podcast." I said, "Oh, I appreciate that call-out."

**Divya:** Aw, that's nice.

**Jerod Santo:** Happy to help you get in the flow. It's the opposite for me - I don't wanna listen to podcasts.

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, I do.

**Chris Coyier:** What I actually do is -- like, do something that you're in the mood to do. If I'm like "I just feel like coding on this thing", then I'll get flow, because I'm not fighting against what I wanna do.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. Work on something that you feel like working on.

**Dave Rupert:** Where was "Wander around Home Depot for nine hours"? \[laughter\] Was that on the list?

**Jerod Santo:** That's funny, because one person said "Procrastinate for ten hours."

**Divya:** Nice. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** There's the honesty right there. And then a few people said "Drink alcohol and smoke weed", and I thought "I've never been in the flow in these states." I don't know. Different strokes for different folks, I guess.

Alright, so no steal, so ShopTalk gets the points... They missed the last one, but they still managed to score 110 points in the round.

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, wow...

**Chris Coyier:** That's gonna \[unintelligible 00:26:48.06\]

**Divya:** Nice...

**Jerod Santo:** Major league comeback. After three rounds we have Syntax with 137 and ShopTalk with 173.

**Dave Rupert:** Balance restored, balance restored...

**Divya:** That's a big gap.

**Jerod Santo:** We now move to round four...

**Wes Bos:** Hey, stop giving them easy questions... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** This is called The Inverted Round. This round works a little bit different than our previous rounds. There's no face-off, it's just a back and forth between the two teams. So we just rotate back and forth... And you're trying to match the board, but it's inverted. So you wanna match the bottom of the board, not the top of the board.

So there are six things on the board, and the bottom one get 60 points, and the top gets 10 points. There's lots of points to be had, but you wanna match the board, but at the bottom. Okay?

So we asked 140 handsome JS Party listeners "Name your favorite HTML element." There are six common answers, and since Team Syntax is losing, we'll let them go first, and we'll start with Divya. Divya...

**Divya:** Oh my gosh, this is so hard...

**Jerod Santo:** ...name a favorite HTML element. Remember, you do not want to have the most favorite.

**Divya:** I'm trying to think of the bottom ones...

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, my God...

**Jerod Santo:** And we will have no conferring during this time.

**Wes Bos:** \{28:11\} Yeah, but you don't want the ones that are so far gone... You want the six most popular elements.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. Four, five and six are the sweet spot.

**Wes Bos:** Yeah.

**Divya:** I'm thinking span...

**Wes Bos:** That's what I would have said. It's number four.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "span". \[fail sound\]

**Divya:** What?!

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, span didn't make the board.

**Scott Tolinski:** Who don't like span?!

**Divya:** No one likes span?

**Jerod Santo:** It has to be your favorite...

**Divya:** It's all these React developers... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, exactly.

**Wes Bos:** All these React devs just using divs for everything...

**Divya:** I know, seriously...

**Dave Rupert:** Why use span when you can \[unintelligible 00:28:40.04\]

**Jerod Santo:** Div inline-block, love it. Okay, we go over to Team ShopTalk. Let's have Amelia, "Name a favorite HTML element."

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Uh-oh... It might be way too obscure, but I know it's got some fans out there... We're gonna go with marquee.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "marquee". \[win alert\]

**Dave Rupert:** Good answer, good answer...

**Scott Tolinski:** Well done!

**Jerod Santo:** Good answer. That's the number two answer, actually... So \[unintelligible 00:29:11.02\]

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Oh... Not obscure... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** It turns out it's not that obscure... So you get 20 points for that one. And we go back now to Syntax... And we'll have Scott.

**Scott Tolinski:** Let's think here, about HTML elements... What elements do I like a lot? Let's say button.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "button". Number three answer, button.

**Scott Tolinski:** Whoa! Good!

**Jerod Santo:** So we get 30 points for that one. Well played. So now number two and number three are taken. Marquee and button. So number one, four, five and six are still out there... And we go now to Chris.

**Chris Coyier:** Okay, so we're just going back and forth here? That's another way?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, we're just gonna go back and forth.

**Chris Coyier:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Two of six have been answered...

**Chris Coyier:** And one's gonna be -- oh, why would I give you answers? I'm not gonna do that.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Chris Coyier:** I'm gonna hope that "a" is on the list. A, the Inker element.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "a". \[fail sound\]

**Dave Rupert:** That checks out. It's a JavScript podcast. \[laughter\] \[unintelligible 00:30:12.02\]

**Jerod Santo:** I'll just say, personally, "a" is my favorite element, personally...

**Chris Coyier:** On-click as an attribute...?

**Scott Tolinski:** Div with an on-click, yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** Div with an on-click... \[laughs\] I think we all are hovering around number one... Okay, so we go from Chris over to Wes on Team Syntax.

**Wes Bos:** I'm gonna go paragraph tag.

**Jerod Santo:** Paragraph tag. Is it popular? \[win sound\] It is.

**Divya:** Nice!

**Jerod Santo:** That's the number five answer.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah! Points, points, points, points...

**Jerod Santo:** So you score a whopping 50 points on that..

**Chris Coyier:** Dang...! Fifty?

**Wes Bos:** Yes. Oh, that probably put us ahead.

**Dave Rupert:** Don't you wanna get less points, for some reason, on this weird round?

**Jerod Santo:** So that was Wes. Now we're looking back around to Amelia.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** It's Dave's turn.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you're right. Dave's turn. Sorry, Dave.

**Dave Rupert:** We need something less popular than "p", but more popular than, like, the Ruby element... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** That's quite a range...

**Dave Rupert:** So... "ul".

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "ul". \[fail sound\]

**Divya:** Oh, no... \[unintelligible 00:31:21.00\]

**Scott Tolinski:** All that default styling...

**Dave Rupert:** I forgot it's a JavScript podcast!

**Divya:** It's a React podcast now.

**Jerod Santo:** Just think, "Is there anybody out there who thinks "My favorite element is an unordered list. I just lov 'em."

**Wes Bos:** Divya, now we have to decide if we take the easy, known number one, or risk it for the biscuit.

**Divya:** I know...

**Scott Tolinski:** I think we take the easy points, if you're asking me...

**Divya:** We can take the easy one and then go for the later one...

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah.

**Divya:** That's probably a good strategy.

**Chris Coyier:** You might be sick of the joke, but look at your name, you know...?

**Divya:** I know...! Clearly, you have a Div on the team, gotta use it. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "div... ya". \[win alert\] Yes, of course, the number one answer.

**Wes Bos:** Nice job.

**Jerod Santo:** 45 respondents' answer was div. Okay. We now have number one, div, number two, marquee... I can't remember the other ones. Number five, "p" tag.

**Divya:** \{32:15\} I think it was like button and "p".

**Wes Bos:** Button is number three, marquee is number two.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, that's right. So we're missing four and six.

**Dave Rupert:** Okay. There's only like 112 elements left in there, so... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Each team has one strike, so if you strike out, then we'll end the round. So you have a couple of guesses left. That was Divya, so now we're back to Amelia, right?

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Yeah. I like images... Kind of obscure, but also very nice...

**Dave Rupert:** Okay, let's go, let's go... Let's go!

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "image". \[fail sound\]

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Who doesn't love an image?!

**Wes Bos:** I would have thought that would be on.

**Chris Coyier:** For sure, that's a good guess.

**Jerod Santo:** Yup. So two strikes for ShopTalk... Let's go back over to Syntax. We're back to Scott.

**Scott Tolinski:** Favorite. Hm... Let's see...

**Chris Coyier:** Consider the ruby tag, that's really popular.

**Divya:** I love it.

**Scott Tolinski:** It's pretty popular. So for annotations, or something...

**Jerod Santo:** Superscript, that's a good one.

**Dave Rupert:** The WBO...

**Wes Bos:** WBR, yeah...

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah, WBR... \[laughter\]

**Divya:** The table element...

**Scott Tolinski:** Let's say the nav element.

**Jerod Santo:** Getting semantic... Show me nav. \[fail sound\]

**Divya:** Aww, man...

**Scott Tolinski:** Sorry, my bad.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, each team has one more guess. One more correct guess. So here we go, back over to Team ShopTalk. It's Chris again, right? Yeah, Chris.

**Chris Coyier:** I'm gonna just shout out h1.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah, that was my second guess.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us h1. \[fail sound\] Ah, there's too many elements...

**Wes Bos:** Alright, here's my last one... Am I allowed to confer on this one?

**Jerod Santo:** No.

**Wes Bos:** For the sake of like a good podcast...? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** For the sake of good podcasting? No... Uninterested.

**Wes Bos:** Okay. Well, I'm gonna think out loud here. I'm either thinking header/footer, or body, or html.

**Divya:** Oh. Super-meta.

**Wes Bos:** Do you think people will be sassy enough to say -- like, "What's your favorite HTML tag?" "Html". Body, header, footer... I'm gonna say...

**Scott Tolinski:** There's too many choices.

**Wes Bos:** Part of me wants to say html. I'm saying body though.

**Jerod Santo:** I'll tell you - that body was answered by one person. \[fail sound\] It did not make the top six.

**Wes Bos:** Okay. Svg...

**Jerod Santo:** So - still, pretty good scoring on that round. Number four most popular element, input.

**Divya:** Oh, input.

**Scott Tolinski:** People like input?!

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Nobody likes inputs...

**Divya:** Inputs are the worst-styled...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, but they make you be able to do things on your website.

**Divya:** That's true.

**Jerod Santo:** And the number six most popular... Hey, it is a JavScript podcast after all - script.

**Divya:** Oh, what...?!

**Wes Bos:** I forgot that that was part of HTML. I thought it was part of WebPack...

**Jerod Santo:** Honorable mentions - a couple people mentioned iFrame... UL was mentioned by a couple people. The picture element was mentioned twice... Somebody said "Keep it on the DL", so they're being very cute with that... And someone actually said div, and then in parentheses they put "ya", so Divya \[unintelligible 00:35:16.29\]

**Scott Tolinski:** We get points for that though, right?

**Divya:** Yes, we get points.

**Jerod Santo:** I counted that towards the div, so they got their points. Alright, so in that round, ShopTalk scored 20 and Syntax scored 90. So we have a game here... It's going back and forth, and after four rounds, syntax is in the lead with 227, and ShopTalk trails with 193. It's anybody's game at this point.

**Break:** \{35:40\}

**Jerod Santo:** We now go to round five, and I'll tell you, in round five all scoring is doubled, so it's certainly anybody's match... Let's get back to the face-off. And everybody has faced off at this point, correct?

**Dave Rupert:** I believe so...

**Jerod Santo:** I think so, because it's round -- yes, so we'll go back to the top of the face-off, with Amelia and Divya. And Amelia guessed first last round, so we'll let Divya go first this round. Alright, so there's four answers on the board... Divya, name a common mistake that developers make.

**Divya:** This is such a broad question... A common mistake developers make?

**Jerod Santo:** It even rhymes. I've just noticed that.

**Divya:** They spell debugger wrongly.

**Dave Rupert:** I'm not on your team, but good answer, good answer... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "Spelling things wrong." \[win alert\]

**Divya:** Yes!!

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, wow!

**Jerod Santo:** So we've joined forces... Typos and misspellings was the number one answer; I combined the two. So there's 29 there, with typos and misspellings. Because what is a misspelling if not a typo, and vice-versa. I mean, you end up spelling it wrong when you typo. So pretty much the same thing. That's 29 points, and you get to play the round.

**Wes Bos:** Alright!

**Divya:** Let's go!

**Jerod Santo:** Team Syntax in control. You have three things left on the board. Of course, you have three strikes to give... Scott, it's your turn. Name a common mistake that developers make.

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, gosh... I don't make mistakes very much, I don't know... \[laughter\] Let's see...

**Dave Rupert:** It's tough, I get it. I get it. It's tough.

**Divya:** Scott makes no mistakes.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah, never, ever, including not spelling things wrong, ever... Let's see. Here's a decent answer; I don't know if this will work - they pick the wrong technology.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "pick the wrong tech." \[fail sound\]

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, man...

**Divya:** That was very valid, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Not bad, but didn't quite make the board... Alright, Wes, it's your turn.

**Wes Bos:** Alright... Would syntax error be covered under spelling things wrong?

**Chris Coyier:** Ah, boo...! \[laughter\]

**Wes Bos:** Is that what he was gonna guess?

**Chris Coyier:** No, it's just -- it's your namesake.

**Jerod Santo:** It's your namesake.

**Wes Bos:** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, syntax is a big mistake.

**Chris Coyier:** It is? \[laughter\]

**Wes Bos:** I'm gonna go like syntax error--

**Jerod Santo:** I think I lumped it in with typos. I think I did, because I'm not seeing it...

**Divya:** I think that's similar to typos though, yeah?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Wes Bos:** Alright, I have another one then...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Wes Bos:** Forgetting to save.

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, that's a good one.

**Divya:** Good one.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "Forgetting to save". \[fail sound\]

**Divya:** What?! Oh, man... I guess it's just us...

**Amelia Wattenberger:** It's a tough one.

**Wes Bos:** They've got autosave on.

**Jerod Santo:** There we go. Alright, so two strikes...

**Scott Tolinski:** That's crazy.

**Dave Rupert:** What's the average age of the audience? Are they all 12-year-olds on iPads, and everything is autosaved? \[laughs\] Oh, man...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, we're back at Divya.

**Divya:** Okay, cool. I think a common mistake that developers will have is -- okay, this is very generic, but messing up version control, or Git commits.

**Wes Bos:** Oh, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Hm. Show me "Git problems". \[fail sound\]

**Dave Rupert:** What...?!

**Divya:** Amazing.

**Jerod Santo:** So that's three strikes...

**Scott Tolinski:** All the things on my list are X'es. Yeah, this is crazy.

**Divya:** \{40:19\} I know. I was like, "Come on."

**Jerod Santo:** So ShopTalk can steal... There's still three things on the board. We only have number one.

**Wes Bos:** No, we only got two wrong.

**Divya:** We only got two, didn't we?

**Jerod Santo:** All three of you got one wrong, didn't you?

**Chris Coyier:** Picked wrong tech, forget to save, Git mistakes...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, there we go. Chris \[unintelligible 00:40:33.00\]

**Wes Bos:** Oh... Come on, give us one more. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, ShopTalk, you can confer amongst yourselves...

**Chris Coyier:** Oh, we get to talk. That's right.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Scott Tolinski:** There's only five answers, or...?

**Jerod Santo:** Four total. Three left.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** There's no points to steal here...

**Jerod Santo:** It is a low-scoring round, yeah....

**Chris Coyier:** They deploy on Friday, is a possible answer... \[laughter\]

**Dave Rupert:** Deploy on Friday... Messing up types, like trying to add a number in a string?

**Chris Coyier:** Type coercion, or whatever?

**Dave Rupert:** Type coercion...

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Or really big bundles, or memory leaks...

**Chris Coyier:** Oh, performance problems.

**Dave Rupert:** Performance? Okay, I like that...

**Wes Bos:** Div as a button... \[laughter\]

**Dave Rupert:** Semantic elements, yeah...

**Chris Coyier:** How do you say performance -- do you just say like "Do performance bad...?"

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah, like bad performance...

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah, you can say "Do performance bad." I think that's the way to say it... \[laughter\]

**Wes Bos:** Yeah, you should say that.

**Dave Rupert:** Oh, no... Wes is in the database, like -- Wes has reverse-engineered the form. \[laughter\]

**Chris Coyier:** He found the form printouts in the dumpster out back...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright... Show us "Do performance bad". \[fail sound\] \[laughter\] Fail to steal.

**Wes Bos:** I was gonna say "Refresh production."

**Jerod Santo:** So a lot of missed ones here. This was a trouble round. Number two answer, "Off by one errors."

**Wes Bos:** Oh, that's good.

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah, yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** Number three, "Forgetting semi-colons."

**Divya:** That's a syntax error.

**Scott Tolinski:** I purposefully do that, yeah.

**Wes Bos:** I said "Syntax error, forgetting semi-colon." \[laughter\] Roll the tape...

**Jerod Santo:** It was a very specific response, so I let it have its own.

**Divya:** That's a stylistic thing, too...

**Wes Bos:** I specifically said semi-colon though...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, you did?

**Wes Bos:** Yeah.

**Divya:** Wes did say that. He did say syntax.

**Jerod Santo:** My fault, I'm sorry. I heard "syntax error", and then Chris started making fun of it, and I...

**Scott Tolinski:** Point, point, point, point-point...

**Wes Bos:** Alright, we'll get that back.

**Jerod Santo:** Everybody missed it. My bad. Number four, premature optimization.

**Dave Rupert:** Okay. Fair enough.

**Jerod Santo:** Now, there's a lot of them that just barely missed the top four...

**Dave Rupert:** Who put that answer? Was that Kyle Simpson, or something? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Spamming our forum? Yeah, perhaps... There's a bunch of them that were tied at five. Breaking production was answered a lot, editing or testing the wrong things... So that's similar to what you were talking about there, Wes, with not saving... Leftover console logs... Bad docs, no docs, and then over-engineering. Those were all mentioned five times. One person said "Building the wrong thing."

**Wes Bos:** "Oh, I accidentally built a website for it."

**Jerod Santo:** One said "Building things nobody wants."

**Chris Coyier:** Yeah... Showed up to meeting... \[laughter\]

**Divya:** Built a div instead of a button...

**Jerod Santo:** One person said "Writing code", and then one person said "Getting stuck in Vim."

**Scott Tolinski:** Getting stuck in Vim... \[laughs\]

**Divya:** Oh, man...

**Jerod Santo:** Every Frontend Feud has to have a Vim reference, and there it is...

**Divya:** Come on...

**Jerod Santo:** So there's your trolls. Alright, so there's 29 points scored by team syntax, and since it's a double round, we will double that...

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah!

**Wes Bos:** Do we get points for the semi-colon, too?

**Jerod Santo:** No.

**Divya:** We fought hard and we lost.

**Jerod Santo:** I apologize.

**Wes Bos:** That's an upset.

**Divya:** \[unintelligible 00:43:43.17\]

**Jerod Santo:** So after round five, it's Syntax 285, and ShopTalk 193. We have just one round left.

**Divya:** Sick...! Let's go!

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, round six is also a double score round, so this is ShopTalk's big chance to make a comeback. Step right up. Chris versus Scott. Now, which one of you two got the first guess last time around? Was it Scott? We'll let Chris take the first guess here.

**Scott Tolinski:** \{44:12\} I did.

**Jerod Santo:** Round six, a double round... We asked 140 intelligent JS Party listeners "Name an organization that helps push the web forward." Chris.

**Chris Coyier:** The W3C.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me the "W3C". That is the number three answer. It's not the number one answer, which means Scott has a chance to take the round... Scott, name an organization that helps push the web forward.

**Scott Tolinski:** An organization...

**Divya:** You've got it, you've got it.

**Scott Tolinski:** ...that helps -- an organization. Does that include non-profits, like the -- um, helps push the web forward. Man, this is tough... I don't know...

**Jerod Santo:** Take a guess.

**Scott Tolinski:** Let's say...

**Wes Bos:** Come on, Scott, we had a show on this.

**Divya:** Phone a friend!

**Scott Tolinski:** We had a show on this?

**Jerod Santo:** No helping him...!

**Scott Tolinski:** We had a show on this... \[unintelligible 00:45:06.03\] \[laughter\]

**Dave Rupert:** Scott's now going through 300 episodes... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** We're gonna need an answer here, Scott... Guess one.

**Scott Tolinski:** Shoot! Shoot! I don't know... Organization that helps push the web forward... I'm sorry, Wes. I'm very sorry. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Wes is trying to provide visual aids here... \[laughter\]

**Dave Rupert:** Whoa, whoa, whoa...! We've got some baseball --

**Jerod Santo:** This is table talk... Apparently he wants you to steal a base... I don't know what he's doing.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah, I don't know what he's saying either.

**Dave Rupert:** The Baltimore Orioles? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Scott...

**Scott Tolinski:** I'm so sorry. Yeah, FreeCodeCamp. Who cares.

**Jerod Santo:** FreeCodeCamp. Show me "FreeCodeCamp."

**Wes Bos:** Oh, that's a good one.

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail sound\]

**Divya:** That's pretty good though.

**Dave Rupert:** I liked it.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. ShopTalk gets the round. ShopTalk, you're well-positioned to steal this game right here and now. Chris got the number three answer. There's five total answers on the board...

**Chris Coyier:** We've got this. We've got it.

**Jerod Santo:** So there's four left. Numbers one, two, four and five, and we go to Dave. Dave, name an organization that helps push the web forward.

**Dave Rupert:** Google Chrome... Google...

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "Google". Number two answer, Google.

**Scott Tolinski:** That makes sense.

**Jerod Santo:** With 28 responses.

**Scott Tolinski:** I wasn't thinking like corporations...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, that's two and three. One, four and five are left. Amelia. It's up to you.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I'm gonna go with MDN.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "Mozilla Developer Network." Yes, number one answer; over 51 answers were Mozilla and MDN.

**Dave Rupert:** Yes!

**Jerod Santo:** So... Killin' it. You have just --

**Chris Coyier:** But we can lose it if we don't get the fourth one...

**Jerod Santo:** ...two left. There's five total. There's two left.

**Divya:** Oh, no...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, back to you, Chris.

**Chris Coyier:** Oh, boy. Two left? Uh-oh... It's not gonna be freakin' Apple, right? All they get is yelled at for not pushing the web forward...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Divya:** WebKit everything...

**Jerod Santo:** Remember, you get three strikes, so you can throw one out there and see what happens.

**Chris Coyier:** Oh, that's true. I'm just gonna go with Microsoft, because they actually do work on the web. Microsoft.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "Microsoft". Survey says... Number five answer. So now you've gotten one, two, three and five. There's one answer left, and you have three strikes, so you're sitting pretty... Dave, it's to you.

**Dave Rupert:** I'll do TC39. ECMAScript...

**Jerod Santo:** Show me TC39... \[win sound\]

**Dave Rupert:** Eeey!

**Divya:** Wow, man...!

**Wes Bos:** That was the one I was telling Scott we did a show on.

**Divya:** Yeah, I know, I was like --

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I was gonna say CSS-Tricks.

**Scott Tolinski:** Why were you touching your head? I was thinking like "Head. What's got a head involved?"

**Divya:** I didn't get the hat thing...

**Wes Bos:** Look at your hat! What hat are you wearing?

**Scott Tolinski:** It's a GitHub hat. \[laughter\]

**Dave Rupert:** Oh, GitHub would be a good answer, yeah...

**Divya:** That is true, yeah.

**Chris Coyier:** I would have said Smashing Magazine personally...

**Divya:** Well, GitHub is Microsoft at this point...

**Jerod Santo:** \{48:14\} That's true. So that was a huge round for ShopTalk. That was round six, the final round. It was also a double round...

**Wes Bos:** Oh, man...

**Jerod Santo:** They've scored all of the points, and when you double all those points, that round alone was 216 points.

**Dave Rupert:** Oh, yeah!!

**Scott Tolinski:** I'm so sorry...

**Jerod Santo:** So, with 409 points, the winner of Frontend Feud super-colab is ShopTalk.

**Chris Coyier:** I've never lost on this program! \[laughter\]

**Scott Tolinski:** I'm so sorry, guys...

**Wes Bos:** Congratulations... You stole it from us...

**Divya:** I know...

**Scott Tolinski:** "No, thanks" to double points, yeah...

**Divya:** Killer

**Scott Tolinski:** I like my points non-doubled, okay? Thank you. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Well, ShopTalk, congratulations on the big win. What do you win? Well, you win an opportunity to shout-out or say whatever you like. You cannot gloat. You must say something not about syntax. It has to be anything else. Shout-out something. This is your chance to speak to the JS Party listeners.

**Dave Rupert:** Chris, do you wanna go? You said you had something earlier...

**Chris Coyier:** I was just thinking of it, because it came across my desk... There's like a local feud in town here, in Bend, and this guy is really mad that they've put a gate on his property... And he made a whole website about the gate and how mad he is about it... And I wanna shout out to feud websites, because we're playing the feud anyway...

**Jerod Santo:** Nice.

**Chris Coyier:** I think it's extra-cool to make a website out of your madness. \[laughter\]

**Dave Rupert:** Make the beef public... Just make that beef public. \[laughter\]

**Wes Bos:** Well, at least build something constructive...

**Chris Coyier:** Yeah.

**Dave Rupert:** That's beautiful. My shout-out is gonna be to Amelia's cool GitHub visualization project, to help you visualize a GitHub repo in a non-directory-of-files way... I think it's really cool, so...

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Thanks, Dave.

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** I will double that effort. I think I shouted it out last episode; we're so impressed we just keep bringing it up, Amelia. Nice work. Would you like to give a shout-out, maybe back to Dave, or anybody else?

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I was actually gonna say CSS-Tricks for the last question, so... Shout-out to CSS-Tricks, even though it wasn't on the board, for some reason...

**Chris Coyier:** For pushing the web forward? I agree. That's what I do...

**Jerod Santo:** I should say there were a couple of honorable mentions that round, and in all of the excitement, I forgot about them. So the Chromium team themselves got a couple of shout-outs... Vercel got three shout-outs, the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) got four, and then a couple people shouted out open source, even though it's not an organization... But definitely, the open source community pushing things forward.

I will back up what Amelia said and say CSS-Tricks is definitely pushing web developers and web development forward over the years... As well as y'all's podcasts... Awesome stuff continuing to put out...

**Wes Bos:** Totally.

**Scott Tolinski:** As well as FreeCodeCamp too, right? That's also a good one, yeah?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, absolutely.

**Wes Bos:** I'm surprised that one wasn't on there...

**Jerod Santo:** It got one mention, I believe...

**Wes Bos:** \{51:08\} And Level Up Tutorials...

**Dave Rupert:** Yup.

**Jerod Santo:** Level Up Tutorials, yeah. Anything else to shout out?

**Scott Tolinski:** Wes Bos' blog... \[laughter\]

**Wes Bos:** WesBos.com/courses.

**Dave Rupert:** React For Beginners wasn't on there, because I feel like 100% of people who know React know it because of Wes' course. So it's not on there...?

**Wes Bos:** There we go. We got all our plugs in. There we go.

**Dave Rupert:** Yup, there we go.

**Jerod Santo:** Definitely should have been on there. Well, we'll give one last shout-out to a JS Party listener, the winner of the free JS Party T-shirt. Remember, everybody who took the survey had a chance at it... It is \[drum roll\] Geneve Parish. Geneve, you won a free shirt.

**Divya:** Yaay!

**Chris Coyier:** That was so sad... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Of course, that means that 139 of you did not win, but don't fret; you can always just buy yourself a shirt at merch.changelog.com, how about that? And as a bonus, since I'm feeling generous, we'll also give out a free shirt to one random member of our JS Party community Slack... So if you don't hang out in there with us, you should. It's \#jsparty. You can hop in there at changelog.com/community; it's all free, hang out during the live shows, talk web dev with us... And on September 17th I decided we'll just pick a random person in that channel and we'll ship you a free JS Party T-shirt as well.

I wanna thank the guys from Syntax and ShopTalk for joining the show and playing this awesome game with us. A round of applause for just the participation right there... And of course, thank you to Divya and Amelia for sprinkling the JS Party into the show. I love it. Thank you all listeners for playing along with us. This has been Frontend Feud, this has been JS Party, and we will talk to you next time.
