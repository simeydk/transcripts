**Emma Bostian:** Welcome to JS Party, JS Jeopardy edition! Yaay, we're so excited! This should be super-fun. I'm really pumped. It's more than just JavScript, so don't get too excited, but JS Jeopardy sounded way better than Miscellaneous Web Frontend Question Jeopardy.

I'm gonna explain the rules really quickly, and then we'll just go ahead and jump right in. The way this is gonna work is I have put together a Google presentation that no one else can see... Which is fine, because we're gonna be talking. I'm gonna share this with you now, so you'll be able to see the categories on the screen and see which ones have been taken already... So let me get this up...

**Kevin Ball:** Schmancy!

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah I put way too much effort into this. I should have had this all worked out, but you know... Last-minute preparations. So while I'm getting this up, we'll start with Jake, since Jake is our guest... Really quickly, Jake, do you wanna introduce yourself while I get my life together over here?

**Jake Dohm:** Sure. I am Jake Dohm, web developer at Good Work Software Consultancy out of Dallas. I build websites and tweet about JavScript at @JakeDohm. Don't come troll me, or do... Yeah.

**Emma Bostian:** Awesome. We're super-excited to have you on, and I'm just gonna wish you the best of luck. So here are the categories for round one. We're gonna start off with five categories, in increments of 100 points. So they start at 100, they go all the way up to 500, and there are five questions in each category.

The first category is CSS, the second is JavScript level 1, the third is JavScript level 2, and those levels have no semantic meaning. They're just miscellaneous JavScript questions... But I did try to grade them, so that the 100 questions should be maybe a little bit easier than the 500's. Then we've got the Web as the fourth category, and lastly, I'm Feeling Lucky.

**Kevin Ball:** Which is about Google?

**Emma Bostian:** No, it's not... \[laughter\] They're just random. We'll have topics, but I thought that sounded more funny than Miscellaneous. So this is round one... We will do a round two afterwards, and then we'll have a final question where you can bet all or nothing.

**Jake Dohm:** Uh-oh...

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah. As opposed to you ringing buzzers, because this is not a practical way to do this, we're gonna start with Jake. Jake, you'll just pick your category and your question. If you get it right, perfect; we'll just move forward. We'll go to Kball next. If you get it wrong, I'm gonna let Kball have the chance to steal it. But if Kball gets it wrong, we'll end it there and he can start over in a new category. How does that sound?

**Kevin Ball:** Wait, what about Chris?

**Emma Bostian:** Chris comes third. I just didn't wanna go through the full process of explaining it...

**Kevin Ball:** But do we all get the chance to answer it?

**Emma Bostian:** I suppose you could, why not? I mean, the rules can change.

**Jake Dohm:** The double steal.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, double steal. So if Kball gets it wrong and Jake gets it wrong, Chris has the chance to get it right. Alright, so Jake, pick your poison!

**Jake Dohm:** Let's go JavScript level one.

**Emma Bostian:** \{04:04\} JavScript level one, for what point value, sir?

**Jake Dohm:** I'm gonna start off easy, let's go 100.

**Emma Bostian:** For 100. This is to declare a block-scoped element, but cannot be redeclared.

**Jake Dohm:** Const. What is const?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct! 100 points go to Jake.

**Kevin Ball:** Woo-hoo!

**Emma Bostian:** I'm also low-key gonna be having to do math in my head while we do this, because I'm gonna be keeping a score in PowerPoint... So just watch my math, please. Alright, so JavScript Level 1 complete. Alright, Kball, you are up.

**Kevin Ball:** Alright, let's go with CSS for 500.

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, my goodness, you are starting off strong. CSS for 500 - this is the point system with which styles are applied to HTML elements.

**Kevin Ball:** What is specificity?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct! Not a lot of people know specificity as a term...

**Jake Dohm:** Yeah.

**Emma Bostian:** And a lot of people don't even know specificity exists.

**Kevin Ball:** Alright, should we do a diversion into specificity? \[laughs\]

**Emma Bostian:** We can go off on little tangents... And I just wanna preface this with the fact that - why are we doing this? 2020, obviously, is a new year, if you didn't know... And that means a lot of people are probably gonna be looking for jobs, a lot of jobs are now hiring, and as a result, you're gonna have to go through technical interviews... So this is just some casual prep for that.

**Jake Dohm:** Sweet!

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah... Noice! Specificity - I wrote a blog post on it, we can link it in the show notes if you're interested in learning more... But there's also ones with Star Wars characters, and stuff, so we'll link that one too, because - Star Wars. Chris, you are up.

**Christopher Hiller:** I'm Feeling Lucky for 100.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm Feeling Lucky, for 100.

**Christopher Hiller:** I'm feeling anxious. \[laughter\]

**Jake Dohm:** Same.

**Christopher Hiller:** Go ahead...

**Emma Bostian:** This occurs when there's a recursive function without an exit point.

**Christopher Hiller:** Oh, stack overflow?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct! You're all doing real good...

**Christopher Hiller:** Oh, what is a stack overflow, I'm sorry.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, I know... It's hard to remember that phrasing... But yeah, that's really good.

**Jake Dohm:** I thought that was gonna be an infinite loop.

**Emma Bostian:** Well, I guess technically--

**Jake Dohm:** \[unintelligible 00:06:19.11\]

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah... I'm feeling anxious - I feel like that's the title of this episode.

**Jake Dohm:** \[laughs\]

**Emma Bostian:** I think I got that question on a job interview once; I was fresh out of college and I just had no idea... So I'll never forget that. Alright, Jake, we are back to you.

**Jake Dohm:** Well, I'm gonna stick with JavScript. We'll go level 1 for 500.

**Emma Bostian:** For 500... JavScript level 1, for 500... Okay. I'm just scrolling to the section on my iPad if I'm singing, that's why. When trying to access a property of an object, the property will not only be sought in the object, but on this.

**Jake Dohm:** It will not only what?

**Emma Bostian:** It will not only be sought or looked for on the current object, but on this.

**Jake Dohm:** The object prototype?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah! Nice!

**Jake Dohm:** What is...

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, it's okay. We'll be a little lenient.

**Jake Dohm:** I'm a newb.

**Emma Bostian:** So Jake is now 600, we've got Kball at 500, and Chris is at a measly 100. You should feel anxious, Chris... \[laughter\] I'm throwing shade, I'm sorry; I'm a little sassy. Alright, Kball, you are up.

**Kevin Ball:** Let's go with the Web for 500.

**Emma Bostian:** The Web for 500. You guys are just diving right in. Where is this... The Web for 500. This is a conceptual model and is a set of communication protocols used in the internet and similar computer networks.

**Kevin Ball:** Can you repeat the question?

**Emma Bostian:** Absolutely. This is a conceptual model and is a set of communication protocols used in the internet and similar computer networks.

**Kevin Ball:** \{07:57\} The conceptual model... Interesting. Huh. 

**Jake Dohm:** Doo doo doo doo...

**Kevin Ball:** Yeah, I know...

**Emma Bostian:** Five more seconds. Take a guess.

**Kevin Ball:** I'm gonna say "What is HTTP?" but I don't think that's right, because that's not a conceptual model...

**Emma Bostian:** Wrong...

**Jake Dohm:** Oh, no...

**Emma Bostian:** I think you let that term throw you off. Unfortunately, that is incorrect, so it moves on to Chris. Chris, would you like me to repeat the question?

**Christopher Hiller:** What is the OSI model?

**Emma Bostian:** That is also incorrect.

**Christopher Hiller:** Aw...

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, no... Jake it's up to you?

**Jake Dohm:** Okay, could you repeat it one more time, so I can not get it? \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** This is a conceptual model and is a set of communication protocols used in the internet and similar computer networks. Why don't you ignore the words "conceptual model" - this is a set of communication protocols used in the internet and similar computer networks?

**Jake Dohm:** I'm so bad at this type of thing...

**Christopher Hiller:** I call shenanigans...

**Jake Dohm:** ...communication. Like, I don't know... LAN? What is LAN? \[laughter\]

**Christopher Hiller:** If it's protocol, I would say TCP/IP.

**Emma Bostian:** See, that would have been correct.

**Jake Dohm:** Oh...!

**Christopher Hiller:** But conceptual model - well, there is this model of the network stack, and...

**Kevin Ball:** I was in between TCP/IP and HTTP, but... Whatever. We got it.

**Emma Bostian:** Well, hold on to that term \[unintelligible 00:09:24.13\]

**Kevin Ball:** And why choose TCP instead of UDP?

**Emma Bostian:** Because that's the only one I knew... \[laughs\] Don't judge me. Alright, well that round nobody got any points, so... We're back to Kball I believe at this point, right?

**Kevin Ball:** No, because I picked the last question, so it should be Chris.

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, then it's Chris' turn.

**Christopher Hiller:** So everybody's picking these big ones, so I'll do JavScript level 2 or 500, please.

**Emma Bostian:** You've got it. This gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.

**Christopher Hiller:** What is hoisting?

**Emma Bostian:** No, unfortunately it's not hoisting. It's one of these things that everyone always clams up on when they have to give a definition for... Jake, do you have a guess?

**Jake Dohm:** Can I get the question one more time?

**Emma Bostian:** Yup. This gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.

**Jake Dohm:** An outer function scope from inside an inner function...

**Christopher Hiller:** Oh, I think I -- never mind.

**Jake Dohm:** Global scope?

**Emma Bostian:** Incorrect, unfortunately.

**Jake Dohm:** Yeah, I didn't think so...

**Emma Bostian:** Kball looks like he's got it.

**Kevin Ball:** What is a closure?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct! It is a closure! I hate defining closure. That is one of the hardest things... You know, I never get closure. I need closure...

**Jake Dohm:** Dang it... Great steal.

**Kevin Ball:** We all need a little closure.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, that's why it's in the 500 point value. That's a hard one to remember. I think we're back to Jake now...

**Jake Dohm:** I'm gonna get a little out of my comfort zone and hit up that CSS for 400.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay, CSS for 400. This is a long one. I can read it more than once.

**Jake Dohm:** Okay.

**Emma Bostian:** This is used when you wanna modify your site or your application depending on a device's general type, such as print versus screen, or a specific characteristic and parameter, such as screen resolution or browser viewport width.

**Jake Dohm:** What is media queries?

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct. Media query!

**Jake Dohm:** Boom! I had to get one.

**Emma Bostian:** You know, it was just the end of last year I realized media queries was not just about browser resolutions, it's also about like if people have -- what is it?

**Kevin Ball:** It's like "prefers reduced motion" and stuff, right?

**Emma Bostian:** Yes. They also have like accessibility media queries, which is really cool.

**Jake Dohm:** Yeah.

**Emma Bostian:** So... Awesome. Kball, you are up.

**Kevin Ball:** Alright, I'm Feeling Lucky for 500.

**Emma Bostian:** Alrighty, I hope you are feeling lucky...

**Jake Dohm:** Did I get those points, Emma?

**Emma Bostian:** No.

**Jake Dohm:** Let me get those sweet, sweet points. I've gotta see my score all tied up with Kevin here...

**Emma Bostian:** \{12:00\} After we finish this round I'll say out loud the point values again, don't worry.

**Jake Dohm:** Sweet.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah. If I forget to update, please let me know. Alright, Kball, you just wanted I'm Feeling Lucky for 500.

**Kevin Ball:** I chose I'm Feeling Lucky for 500.

**Emma Bostian:** Alrighty, good luck. This is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications, which enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Kevin Ball:** What is cross-site scripting?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct. Cross-site scripting, or XXS. Abso-fruitely.

**Kevin Ball:** \[laughs\] Abso-fruitely... I haven't heard that. I like that.

**Emma Bostian:** Chris, you've really gotta catch up, my friend. For the listeners benefit - Jake has 1,000 points, Kball has 1,500, and Chris has 100. Yes, 100. Come on, Chris! You've got this!

**Christopher Hiller:** I'm not good at interviews, or Jeopardy.

**Jake Dohm:** \[laughs\]

**Emma Bostian:** No one is. That's why I'm hosting and I'm not playing.

**Kevin Ball:** \[laughs\]

**Christopher Hiller:** God, do you wanna trade? Alright, so... JavScript level 1 for 400.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, for 400. This is a primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have just been declared, or the formal arguments for which there are no actual arguments.

**Christopher Hiller:** What is undefined?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct, yay! 400 points. Chris is now at 500. Alright, Jake, you're up.

**Jake Dohm:** Alright, let's go JavScript level 2 for 400.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay. This is a function passed into another function as an argument, and then invoked inside the outer function.

**Jake Dohm:** What is a callback?

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct. That is correct... That was for 400...

**Jake Dohm:** What is Npm install promisify? \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** What even... \[laughs\] Oh, gosh. Alright, Kball, you're up.

**Kevin Ball:** Okay, let's go with the Web for 400.

**Emma Bostian:** The Web for 400. This is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser.

**Kevin Ball:** What is a cookie?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct! I don't understand why things in programming are named after food, or animals...

**Jake Dohm:** \[laughs\]

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, Chris...

**Kevin Ball:** You get a cookie, and you get a cookie, and you get a cookie... \[laughter\]

**Christopher Hiller:** I'm Feeling Lucky for 400.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm Feeling Lucky for 400. This is a technical specification published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that specifies how to increase the accessibility of web pages.

**Christopher Hiller:** What is ARIA?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct! I will give it to you. I had WAI-ARIA written, but ARIA is totally correct. So that brings up to 900. No pressure, Chris, you kind of need this one.

If you guys are not in the JS Party channel, please join us, because it's a lot of fun in that room right now. Alright, Jake, you're up.

**Jake Dohm:** Alright, let's see here... I'm gonna branch out over back into CSS. I'll do 300.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay, CSS for 300. This is used to specify values for animating an element in various stages.

**Jake Dohm:** What is keyframes?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct.

**Jake Dohm:** Wooh!

**Emma Bostian:** Woo-hoo! Like, a lot of these you wouldn't be asked on a technical interview, they're just good to know.

**Jake Dohm:** Yeah. I really need Kevin to drop around here... Alright.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, Kball...

**Kevin Ball:** Alright, let's go with JavScript level 1 for 300.

**Emma Bostian:** Alrighty. This determines the accessibility of variables.

**Kevin Ball:** What is scope?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct. Correct, scope. What's nine plus three? Nine plus three is two. I have such trouble adding simple numbers in my head, but I can draw \[unintelligible 00:15:50.23\] on a board, it's fine.

**Kevin Ball:** Nine plus three is two, so you're natively adding \[unintelligible 00:15:57.12\]

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah. It's really hard for me to remember nine plus-- well, nine's not so bad, but other simple numbers... Seven - forget about it. Anyway... Alright, Chris, you're up.

**Christopher Hiller:** \{16:08\} JavScript, level 2 for 300.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, JavScript level 2 for 300. Guess what - this is double Jeopardy! I don't have any noises, so... That's my noise.

**Jake Dohm:** \[laughs\]

**Kevin Ball:** Wait, how does that work again? Oh, he gets to bet something?

**Emma Bostian:** No, we double the points, so it's actually gonna be for 600. So if he gets it right, he gets 600.

**Kevin Ball:** Woo-hoo!

**Emma Bostian:** Also, if you get it wrong, it's supposed to detract from your score, but since we're not buzzing it, I'm not doing that. You just get it if you get it right. Alright, this is gonna be worth 600 if you get it right... This is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function.

**Christopher Hiller:** What is a higher-order function?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah! Correct! 600.

**Jake Dohm:** That's a good one.

**Kevin Ball:** Jake was ready to steal that...

**Jake Dohm:** I was... I was so ready to steal!

**Emma Bostian:** Well, Jake, he's coming for you. Chris is now at 1,500 with that, Jake's at 1,700, and Kball is at 2,200... So that's getting closer. Alright, let's see what you've got... That's you, Jake; I didn't even say that loud, but it's Jake's turn.

**Jake Dohm:** Let's see... Well, I think I can get another 300 here, so I'll take I'm Feeling Lucky for 300.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay.

**Jake Dohm:** But I'm Not Feeling Lucky, so...

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, let's see... This is a process of changing the position of a web page or a website in search engine results by using keywords or phrases.

**Jake Dohm:** What is search engine optimization?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct.

**Jake Dohm:** Sweet!

**Kevin Ball:** It is about Google I'm Feeling Lucky...

**Emma Bostian:** Well, that one... Alright, you're officially at 2,000.

**Jake Dohm:** Don't forget about Bing, everyone...

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, Kball...

**Kevin Ball:** Alright, I'll take that last number 300 on the Web, for 300.

**Emma Bostian:** The Web for 300. This is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster.

**Kevin Ball:** What is a cache?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct. So Kball is still in the lead by 500 points. Alright, Chris...

**Christopher Hiller:** Give me JavScript level 1 for 200.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright. This is used to declare a block-scoped element and can be redeclared.

**Christopher Hiller:** What is let?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct. Alright, Jake, you are up.

**Jake Dohm:** Let's do JavScript level 2 for 200.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, this represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

**Jake Dohm:** What is a promise?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct. I hate promises, I hate explaining them... I will never get that right in a technical interview... I promise I will get it wrong... \[laughter\] Okay, Kball...

**Kevin Ball:** I'll take CSS for 200.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay, CSS for 200. This is a one-dimensional layout model which distributes elements along an axis.

**Kevin Ball:** What is Flexbox?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct. Flexbox is a wonderful tool, and there are some fun games that you can use to learn it, like Flexbox Froggy. Flexbox Defense I think is another one...

**Kevin Ball:** I just saw a wonderful article about something done actually by a guy who was on our show at some point... Where somebody created a responsive layout that did three different layouts based on size, without a single media query, using Flexbox.

**Emma Bostian:** Dang...

**Kevin Ball:** Or four. Four different layouts, actually.

**Emma Bostian:** I love Flexbox. It's one of the best tools you can learn for CSS.

**Kevin Ball:** Yeah, Adam Argyle shared that...

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, okay... Nice.

**Kevin Ball:** Yeah. Anyway, cool stuff. I can include a link to that in the show notes, and it's gonna be in my newsletter this week; so if you're on that, you should get it.

**Emma Bostian:** Absolutely, for sure.

**Jake Dohm:** I love Flexbox Zombies too, the gamified thing by David Geddes So good. Yeah, that's how I really learned it.

**Emma Bostian:** \{19:58\} Awesome. Well, we're gonna have all these in the show notes if you wanna check them out later. Alright, we've got five questions left before we take a break, so with that I think it's over to Chris now, right? Or are we on Kball?

**Kevin Ball:** No, I just went. It's Chris.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay.

**Christopher Hiller:** I'm Feeling Lucky for 200.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay. This global attribute indicates than an element can be focused in where it participates in sequential keyword navigation.

**Christopher Hiller:** Say that again?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, if I can... I messed up reading it. This global attribute indicates than its element can be focused on and where it participates in sequential keyword navigation.

**Christopher Hiller:** What is tab index?

**Emma Bostian:** Yes, absolutely, what is tab index. Noice! Alright, Jake...

**Jake Dohm:** Well, I guess I'm gonna have to go with the Web. Let's do the Web for 200.

**Emma Bostian:** The Web for 200... This is a protocol for secure communication over a computer network.

**Jake Dohm:** What is HTTPS or SSL? Do I have to pick one?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, you do... \[laughs\]

**Jake Dohm:** They're like the same, right? Like, one is the other -- let's see, the protocol is HTTPS.

**Emma Bostian:** Perfect. That is correct. Awesome. Kball, you are up.

**Kevin Ball:** Alright, let's see... I've got CSS, JavScript Level 2 or the Web. Let's do CSS for 100.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, CSS for 100. This display property allows you to set a width and height on an in-line element.

**Kevin Ball:** A width and a height on an in-line element. What is in-line block?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct. Display in-line block. I mean, I feel like half the answer was in the question, but it's fine. Alright, Chris - pick your poison. Are we going JavScript or are we going the Web?

**Christopher Hiller:** JavScript.

**Emma Bostian:** Alrighty, JavScript level 2 for 100. This represents the intentional absence of any object value.

**Christopher Hiller:** What is null?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct, what is null. When I'm reading some of these, I'm like "I definitely would not have gotten these", but to be fair, I pulled up Mozilla's definitions, so... Alright, Jake, you are bringing us home with the Web.

**Jake Dohm:** Let's do it.

**Emma Bostian:** I don't even know why I was about to ask you which one you wanted. Alright, to finish up this round, the Web for 100. This is the HTTP status code that indicates everything was successful.

**Jake Dohm:** What is 200?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct, what is 200. And with that, I think that wraps up the round. Did I put your point values the last round?

**Kevin Ball:** I think so...

**Christopher Hiller:** I need about 800 more... \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** So in third place we have Chris at 1,900, in second place - a close second place - we've got Jake with 2,500, and Kball is leading with 2,800. We're gonna take a break, but when we come back we've got round two with some other really fun topics.

**Break:** \{23:01\}

**Emma Bostian:** Welcome back to JS Jeopardy! Just to recap, we've got Chris in third place with 1,900 points, but he's doing really well and we're really proud of him. In second we've got Jake with 2,500, and in the lead we've got Kball with 2,800. This round the points are doubled, and we've got some new categories, kind of. The first category is HTML, the second one is CSS Part II, the third is JavScript, the fourth is Even More JavScript, and the last one is JavScript frameworks.

I don't remember who -- Jake, you answered last last time...

**Jake Dohm:** Yeah.

**Emma Bostian:** ...so I think we'll start with Kball this time.

**Kevin Ball:** Alright, let's see... Let's go with JS Frameworks for 1,000.

**Emma Bostian:** JS Frameworks for 1,000. This framework follows the model vue Vue model (MVVM) pattern, was created in 2011, and was just ranked the least interesting JavScript framework in the State of JavScript survey.

**Jake Dohm:** Oh, shade...

**Kevin Ball:** That's obscure...

**Emma Bostian:** That's why it's the highest value... \[laughs\]

**Kevin Ball:** I'm not gonna look up the survey, and I'm actually gonna guess based on the MVVM. What is Knockout.js?

**Emma Bostian:** That is incorrect. Chris, you've got a chance. Come on, you can do this.

**Kevin Ball:** No Google.

**Christopher Hiller:** The most uninteresting?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, this year...

**Christopher Hiller:** What is Backbone.js?

**Emma Bostian:** No, unfortunately that is incorrect.

**Christopher Hiller:** Oh, my god...

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, Jake, you've got a chance...

**Jake Dohm:** Okay, can I get the question one more time?

**Emma Bostian:** You're just stalling... \[laughter\] This framework follows the model vue Vue model (MVVM) pattern, was created in 2011, and was just ranked the least interesting JavScript framework in the State of JavScript survey.

**Jake Dohm:** 2011 is early... MVVM... Honestly, 2011 is a little before my time, but I'm gonna go with -- so it's a framework... Was Angular around all the way back then? That's pre-Angular...

**Emma Bostian:** I'm gonna need an answer, sir...

**Jake Dohm:** Marionette? Didn't that go with Backbone?

**Emma Bostian:** I don't even know what that is.

**Jake Dohm:** Yeah, I don't know... What is "Jake is clueless"?

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, you all unfortunately did not get it, but it was Ember...

**Kevin Ball:** Oh, snap.

**Jake Dohm:** Oh, I was gonna go with Ember! I didn't think it was around back then.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, it was. Well, we're starting off strong this round, so...

**Kevin Ball:** It wasn't called Ember back then though, was it? It was called SproutCore.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, Kball, you're getting all technical; you still would have gotten it wrong... \[laughter\] Alright, spicy... Chris, you're up. \[laughter\]

**Christopher Hiller:** I'll get JavScript again for 1,000.

**Emma Bostian:** JavScript again for 1,000. Okay, this is the way to opt into a restricted variant of JavScript.

**Christopher Hiller:** What is the use strict directive?

**Emma Bostian:** Correct. Yay, you're now in the lead! In a twist of events, Chris has 2,900 points. Kball has 2,800 and Jake has 2,500, so it's really anyone's game at this point...

**Jake Dohm:** Wow...

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, Jake, go for it.

**Jake Dohm:** Let's see... I'll do Even More JavScript for 1,000.

**Emma Bostian:** Even More JavScript for 1,000. This is a JavScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

**Jake Dohm:** What is hoisting?

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct. So Jake now pulls out into the lead!

**Jake Dohm:** Woo-hoo!

**Kevin Ball:** I picked the wrong category... \[laughter\]

**Jake Dohm:** Yeah, I would have picked frameworks too, but that was a good, hard question.

**Emma Bostian:** I feel like you were floating on a cloud though, Kball, and you needed a little reality check, so I think it's only fair...

**Kevin Ball:** That's my life.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm savage right now... Alright, well you're up anyway. You've got a chance to redeem yourself.

**Kevin Ball:** Let's go with CSS Part II then, for 1,000.

**Emma Bostian:** CSS Part II for 1,000. This is double Jeopardy, so this is gonna be worth 2,000 if you get it correct. Alright... This combines other selectors in a way that gives them a useful relationship to each other, and the location of content in the document.

**Kevin Ball:** Can you repeat that?

**Emma Bostian:** This combines other selectors in a way that gives them a useful relationship to each other, and the location of content in the document.

**Kevin Ball:** \{28:18\} Ooh...

**Emma Bostian:** It is a hard one.

**Kevin Ball:** Yeah, so that's interesting... This gives them a useful relationship to each other... I can think of some examples, but I'm trying to remember what it's called.

**Emma Bostian:** Mm-hm... No, he's not googling, Jerod. I see his hands... \[laughs\]

**Kevin Ball:** My hands are up here.

**Emma Bostian:** But I am gonna need an answer, sir...

**Kevin Ball:** What is a sibling selector?

**Emma Bostian:** No, unfortunately that is incorrect... But Chris, you've got a chance to win 2,000 right now.

**Christopher Hiller:** Can you please repeat it?

**Emma Bostian:** I can. Don't get anxious, it's okay... This combines other selectors in a way that gives them a useful relationship to each other, and the location of content in the document. This is not something people normally know the term for, that's why it's valued at 1,000.

**Kevin Ball:** 2,000, double Jeopardy.

**Emma Bostian:** It is 2,000.

**Christopher Hiller:** What is... I don't know. What is CSS? \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** That unfortunately is incorrect, but I appreciated the response. Jake, any idea? You've had a long chance to think about it, so I'm gonna expect an answer pretty quickly here.

**Jake Dohm:** I'm gonna go with the direct descendent selector...

**Emma Bostian:** Unfortunately, that is incorrect... But both what you and Kball said are examples of this, and that is a combinator.

**Jake Dohm:** Oh, nice... Wow.

**Emma Bostian:** And that was even the second word in that question, "This combines...", so it was similar. It's a combinator. But yeah, most people definitely do not know. That was definitely a hard one. Alright, Chris, it is your chance.

**Christopher Hiller:** I'll do JavScript again for 800.

**Emma Bostian:** JavScript again for 800. This is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data and side effects. This is declarative, rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.

**Christopher Hiller:** What is functional programming?

**Emma Bostian:** Absolutely, what is functional programming.

**Jake Dohm:** Yeah, what is functional programming...? \[laughs\]

**Emma Bostian:** Exactly. So you are now at 3,700. Chris is at 3,700 - he is actually in the lead - Jake is in second place at 3,500, and in a twist of events, Kball is last, with 2,800 points. Alright, Jake, you're up...

**Jake Dohm:** My how the turn tables... Let's see. You know you're on JS Party when no one wants to take HTML, so I'm gonna brave that. I'm gonna take HTML for 1,000 and see how it goes.

**Emma Bostian:** HTML for 1,000. It was really hard to find questions for this category \[unintelligible 00:30:53.28\] This element is used to draw graphics and animations.

**Jake Dohm:** Oh, good night; I know it, I'm just blanking out. Let's see - to draw graphics, it starts with an F... Figment... Oh, dang it. Ken Wheeler made a library that uses it...

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, Jake, I need a response...

**Jake Dohm:** What is Figma? I don't know... Dang it!

**Emma Bostian:** Incorrect, unfortunately.

**Jake Dohm:** It's on the tip of my tongue...

**Emma Bostian:** Kball, over to you.

**Kevin Ball:** I'm gonna go with "What is the canvas element?"

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct...

**Jake Dohm:** Yeah, canvas starts with an f, too. It's silent.

**Emma Bostian:** ...putting you in the lead by 100 points. Nice! Alright, Chris, you're up again, and you're doing really well and everyone's rooting for you.

**Kevin Ball:** Wait, what about my turn?

**Christopher Hiller:** Oh wait -- yeah, it's Kevin's turn.

**Emma Bostian:** Is it?

**Kevin Ball:** Because you picked that one, right?

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, shoot. You're up, I'm sorry.

**Jake Dohm:** Yeah, that was a steal...

**Emma Bostian:** My bad, my bad... Alright, Kball, you're up.

**Kevin Ball:** Riding that momentum, I'm gonna go with HTML for 800.

**Jake Dohm:** \[laughs\]

**Emma Bostian:** HTML for 800. This element represents a nested browsing content embedding another HTML page into the current one.

**Kevin Ball:** What is an iFrame?

**Emma Bostian:** \{32:09\} That is correct, what is an iFrame.

**Kevin Ball:** Speaking of being old, have y'all ever used non-iFrames, like the old frames?

**Emma Bostian:** No...

**Kevin Ball:** Yeah, you can do that, too. It's fixed frames, and they do some other interesting stuff.

**Emma Bostian:** I've never even used iFrames, in all honesty... I didn't ever really have a reason to, so...

**Kevin Ball:** Someday, if you ask, I can tell you the story of when I did three layers of framing to embed essentially navigation from a website into a Shopify page that was trying to feel like it was the same as that website. There's some really interesting hacks you can do with iFrames, and back in the day I may have done them all... But that's like ten years ago now, so...

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, wow... Yeah, I would love to learn more about your ZURB Foundation days as well...

**Kevin Ball:** That's true; that's not even that far back, but yeah. Anyway, iFrames are cool and powerful, and you should never use them now, because there's so many other things you can do... \[laughter\] Almost never. Almost never use them.

**Emma Bostian:** Well, now it is actually your turn, Chris.

**Christopher Hiller:** Can I get Even More JavScript for 800?

**Emma Bostian:** Even More JavScript for 800... Okay - this is a hard one, I'm sorry. This refers to the process of using event propagation or bubbling to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated. I would not have gotten this right...

**Christopher Hiller:** Yeah, I'm not sure... What does this have to do with JavScript? \[laughter\] Yeah, I don't know. Pass.

**Emma Bostian:** It's okay. Jake, you're up. Do you have any idea?

**Jake Dohm:** What is event delegation?

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct!

**Jake Dohm:** Hey! Let's go!

**Kevin Ball:** Jake with the steal!

**Emma Bostian:** Eight plus five is twelve, correct?

**Jake Dohm:** It's thirteen, yeah...

**Emma Bostian:** Thirteen. This episode is gonna be called "Emma trying to do math." \[laughter\] Yeah, event delegation - that's one that I feel like I've been asked in a technical interview, but again, had trouble describing, so...

**Jake Dohm:** Yeah. That description - it took me a minute. I had a light bulb moment, but that was after a minute.

**Kevin Ball:** I'm glad you got it, because I would not have.

**Jake Dohm:** \[laughs\]

**Emma Bostian:** It's your turn again, Jake.

**Jake Dohm:** Okay, let's go -- as scared as I am of this category, let's go JS Frameworks for 800.

**Emma Bostian:** JS Frameworks for 800. This is a JavScript library designed to simplify the HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, and was created in 2006.

**Jake Dohm:** What is the best library ever made, jQuery?

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct, jQuery.

**Jake Dohm:** Yay!

**Emma Bostian:** That puts you at 5,100.

**Kevin Ball:** The way you said that, I realized why Jake is calling JAKEuery the best ever...

**Jake Dohm:** \[laughs\] JAKEuery.

**Emma Bostian:** I think that's a new Twitter handle. Alright, Kball, you're up.

**Kevin Ball:** Let's go with the last remaining 800, CSS Part II for 800.

**Emma Bostian:** CSS Part II for 800. This is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element.

**Kevin Ball:** This is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the... Hm. What is a pseudo-selector?

**Emma Bostian:** Um, nope...

**Kevin Ball:** Okay. \[laughs\]

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\] That's over to Chris...

**Christopher Hiller:** A keyword, right?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah... I'm trying to be shady about this, because you were really close, Kball, but it wasn't correct.

**Christopher Hiller:** What is a pseudo-attribute?

**Emma Bostian:** Also very close, but not correct. Jake knows it, doesn't he?

**Jake Dohm:** I think so... What is a pseudo-element selector?

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct. Pseudo-element. There's no selector. So it's just pseudo-element.

**Kevin Ball:** \{36:06\} I'm gonna dispute that... \[laughs\] So pseudo-elements - would you argue that they're actually styling a part of that thing? They're a way to select without -- no, I guess that makes sense... Never mind.

**Jake Dohm:** The description is a little mind-bendy.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, it's like the :: before and :: after, so yeah, it's technically an element that's not an element.

**Kevin Ball:** Yeah. Well, in the newer generations there's also pseudo-elements like first letter, and things like that, which do match that description that you're using there a little bit more closely than how I would think of a before/after... But okay.

**Emma Bostian:** Right...

**Kevin Ball:** Alright, I withdraw my objection.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay... Glad to hear it, because I don't think I had a case. \[laughter\] Okay. Chris, you're up.

**Christopher Hiller:** JavScript again for 600.

**Emma Bostian:** JavScript again for 600. This is a type of event propagation where the event first triggers on the inner-most element, and then successively triggers on the ancestors of the target element in the hierarchy, until it reaches the outer-most element.

**Christopher Hiller:** What is event bubbling?

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct! Event bubbling. Yay! Okay, that was 600, so... What's seven plus six? Someone help me. What's seven plus six?

**Kevin Ball:** Thirteen.

**Emma Bostian:** Thirteen. 4,300. Wow, this is embarrassing... I went to college, I promise... I just really didn't do well at math. Okay, so...

**Kevin Ball:** I'm cheating, because my kids are currently working on this stuff, so...

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, maybe I should practice with them. In first place so far we have Jake at 5,900, we've got Kball at 4,600, and Chris at 4,300. Yeah, I think let's do one more round, then we'll take a break and we'll come back for the last little piece... What do you think?

**Kevin Ball:** Sure.

**Jake Dohm:** Sounds cool.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, cool. Who's turn is it?

**Kevin Ball:** Jake, I think...

**Jake Dohm:** I think it's me.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay.

**Jake Dohm:** Yeah. I'm gonna go with CSS for 600.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay. This is a program that lets you generate CSS from its own unique syntax. This is not an easy one.

**Jake Dohm:** A program? Would you say an application?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah... I would say this is like a tool that lets you generate CSS from its own unique syntax.

**Jake Dohm:** Hm. From its own unique syntax... I'll go with "What is PostCSS?"

**Emma Bostian:** That's a little too specific, so unfortunately I need it to go to Kball.

**Kevin Ball:** I'm gonna say "What is a CSS preprocessor?"

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct.

**Jake Dohm:** Oh, there you go.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah... It's hard to come up with a definition for that, because it's like--

**Jake Dohm:** Yeah...

**Kevin Ball:** I was also gonna say - PostCSS is kind of interesting... It's like, it's Babel for CSS, so it could be used with your own unique syntax, or it could just be mucking around with your CSS.

**Jake Dohm:** Yeah.

**Kevin Ball:** It's a CSS transpiler.

**Emma Bostian:** Hm, nice. Well, Kball, it's up to you now.

**Kevin Ball:** Okay. Well, I've had best luck so far with HTML, so I'm gonna go with HTML for 600.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay. This element represents data that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like base, link, script, style or title.

**Kevin Ball:** Can you repeat that?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah. This element represents data that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like link, base, script, style or title.

**Kevin Ball:** Okay, let's see... I'm gonna do the interview thing and talk my thinking out loud...

**Emma Bostian:** Please do.

**Kevin Ball:** \{39:58\} So that inclines me to believe it is a meta attribute of some sort, because of both the examples given, and there was the word meta in there... So it's some sort of meta attribute, and I'm actually gonna just go with the meta element, because the other examples were elements.

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct. And yeah, it was a little obvious if you listened to the definition... \[laughs\] But you know, I just went with it anyway.

**Kevin Ball:** I tell you, it did not feel obvious.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay. Well, it does if you know the answers... \[laughter\] It's funny how that works; I'd be a terrible interviewer. Alright, Chris, you're up.

**Christopher Hiller:** Can I get Even More JavScript for 600?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, Even More JavScript for 600. This tests whether the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object. I would not get this...

**Christopher Hiller:** Are you looking for a function?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hiller:** Okay. Object dot -- I don't think I ever use this \[unintelligible 00:40:57.20\]

**Emma Bostian:** I don't think it's a proper function, let me take that back... It's a special keyword, I guess, that would check whether the prototype property of a constructor--

**Christopher Hiller:** Oh, yeah - what is the in keyword?

**Emma Bostian:** No. Think about prototypes. I have to pass it to Jake just to be fair, but think about the prototype chain.

**Jake Dohm:** What is "has own prototype"?

**Emma Bostian:** No, that's also not correct.

**Kevin Ball:** Could you repeat the question?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah. This tests whether the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object.

**Kevin Ball:** What is instance of?

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct, yes. Instance of.

**Jake Dohm:** Oh, that's good stuff.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, that's a hard one. Alright, so with that we'll take one more quick break, and then when we come back, we've just got a few more questions, and our final question, and we'll see where everyone stands.

**Break:** \{41:58\}

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, so we are back with the final wrap-up for JS Jeopardy. Unfortunately, Chris had to leave, but we have given him an honorary medal of survival, because he survived... And I think he hates me now. But in any case, Chris, you did a great job. And let's just continue... I don't remember who we left off with?

**Kevin Ball:** I think it's Jake's turn.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright.

**Jake Dohm:** I'll take JS Frameworks for 600... The last 600.

**Emma Bostian:** Alrighty. This is an open source JS framework and was developed by Google in 2010.

**Jake Dohm:** What is Angular?

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct.

**Jake Dohm:** Woo-hoo!

**Emma Bostian:** So now you're at 6,500... Was that right?

**Kevin Ball:** Yeah.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay, cool. Kball, you're up.

**Kevin Ball:** I'm gonna continue to shy away from those JS frameworks and I'll go with HTML for 400.

**Emma Bostian:** HTML for 400. This is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

**Kevin Ball:** Ooh, what is that called...?

**Jake Dohm:** Oh, it has been so long...

**Kevin Ball:** I know exactly where it is, what it looks like... Oh, gosh. I have no idea what that's called. I'm gonna say "What is the page directive?"

**Emma Bostian:** \{44:05\} That is incorrect. I'm looking for a very specific word.

**Jake Dohm:** What is doctype?

**Kevin Ball:** Yes, well done!

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct!

**Kevin Ball:** I forgot... I could not remember. Well done.

**Jake Dohm:** I was racking my brain... It's been so long since I've put a doctype on something...

**Kevin Ball:** You earned that one.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay, so that was for 400. So Jake's at 6,900, Kball's at 6,400... It is a very close match. Alright, Jake, you're up.

**Jake Dohm:** Let's go with JS Frameworks for 400.

**Emma Bostian:** This is an open source JavScript framework created by Evan Yu in 2014, and is very quickly gaining popularity.

**Jake Dohm:** What is the second-best framework/library after jQuery - Vue. \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** I thought you were gonna say React. I was like "Oh, no... So much shade!"

**Jake Dohm:** \[laughs\] I mean... Both are great, don't get me wrong.

**Emma Bostian:** I like Vue a lot, and the community is really nice.

**Jake Dohm:** Truth.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright. Kball, you're up.

**Kevin Ball:** Let's go with JavScript again for 400.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay. This data type lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references.

**Kevin Ball:** What is a variable?

**Emma Bostian:** That is incorrect.

**Kevin Ball:** \[unintelligible 00:45:12.26\]

**Jake Dohm:** Can I get the question?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah. Do you want me to repeat it?

**Jake Dohm:** Yeah.

**Emma Bostian:** This data type lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references. Unique values...

**Jake Dohm:** Yeah, what is a set?

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct.

**Kevin Ball:** Oh, I see. Got it. Yeah, I misheard. Oh, well...

**Emma Bostian:** Sorry, my bad. \[unintelligible 00:45:35.22\]

**Kevin Ball:** No, that's entirely on me. You said the same words to me as to Jake.

**Jake Dohm:** No, I only got it with the second reading, when she said "unique". I was like "It can't just be an object..." Yeah, that was a good question.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, Jake, it's back to you.

**Kevin Ball:** You're running away with it.

**Jake Dohm:** Let's see... I'll take CSS for 400.

**Emma Bostian:** This is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element.

**Jake Dohm:** It's not a specific state... What is a pseudo-selector?

**Emma Bostian:** Incorrect. Alright, Kball, you know this. It is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state.

**Kevin Ball:** Yeah... I know the examples of it, right? This is like hover, or...

**Emma Bostian:** I know, I know...

**Kevin Ball:** ...focus... What is it called? It's not called a pseudo-selector, because that's... Hm.

**Emma Bostian:** It was pretty close, just sayin'...

**Kevin Ball:** What is a state selector?

**Emma Bostian:** No, you changed the wrong part of the answer. It's actually a pseudo-class.

**Kevin Ball:** A pseudo-class... Oh, yeah. Okay.

**Emma Bostian:** Yup.

**Jake Dohm:** I didn't know there was a difference.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah.

**Kevin Ball:** A pseudo-selector is gonna do something like first child, or something like that, right? That's gonna --

**Jake Dohm:** Oh, yeah... There you go. Alright. Learn something every day.

**Emma Bostian:** Um, are we back to Kball? Is this Kball's...?

**Kevin Ball:** Yeah. By the way, we're noticing -- these types of interview questions, if you're asking these, don't.

**Emma Bostian:** Don't. Don't do it!

**Kevin Ball:** Don't do it. Jake, I actually don't know your background, but between Chris and I, we have dozens of years of experience, lots of huge product stuff... Jake, I'm sure you're very successful, I just don't know your background... And we're totally missing these, because they don't actually measure anything that will help you code.

**Emma Bostian:** No. Although to be fair, I was asked to define a closure and I just looked at them and I was just like "Um... Okay..."

**Kevin Ball:** That's actually a really good -- you should call them out. If you're getting asked these questions, call out your interviewer. Be like "What are you testing for? You're not testing for my ability to code."

**Emma Bostian:** \{47:50\} Yeah... That's really hard though. It's really hard in the moment, when you're the -- "subordinate" is not the right word, but you're not in a position of interviewing, so it's really uncomfortable to just call someone out and be like "Well, actually, it's a terrible question..." "I can explain how it works and I can show you what it's useful for, but I can't give you a definition."

**Kevin Ball:** Yeah. And hopefully, at some point you flip into the mode or there's enough abundance for you or there's enough opportunities for you where you're also interviewing them, to be like "Is this a place I wanna work?" and if they're asking questions like these, the answer is probably no. So yeah... I mean, there's lots of good ways to do interviews, there's lots of bad ways to do interviews, and we should be having this conversation -- I think we talked about this in the All Things Open episode and a few other things. This type of interview question is not helpful for interviewing... But it's fun. So let's keep rolling out, I don't wanna detour us too far.

**Emma Bostian:** Correct, yeah. And as a last note, these are really good topics to know about. You don't need to know their definitions, but understanding pseudo-selectors is really important, understanding CSS specificity is important, and understanding scope, closure, all those things. In any case...

**Kevin Ball:** Oh, absolutely. And they are valuable topics, and these are really useful -- this would be really good as a way to like "Oh, I don't know anything about that. Let me go study it." But yeah, don't be using them in interview questions. Alright, last 400, Even More JavScript.

**Emma Bostian:** Even More JavScript for 400. Do you know how hard it is to find things on an iPad when things aren't organized...? Okay. Even More JavScript for 400. This operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operant--

**Kevin Ball:** What is the type of operator?

**Emma Bostian:** I didn't read that definition out before... I literally was like "Give away..." Yes, the type of... Okay, Jake, you're up.

**Jake Dohm:** I'll take HTML for 200.

**Emma Bostian:** HTML for 200.

**Jake Dohm:** Trying to steal Kball's Gimme HTML over there.

**Emma Bostian:** This element represents a portion of the document whose content is only indirectly related to the main content.

**Jake Dohm:** What is aside?

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct. You have 7,900 and Kball has 6,800. It's okay, Kball, there's a last chance you'll have to catch up.

**Kevin Ball:** It's all good. Let's go with CSS Part II for 200.

**Emma Bostian:** CSS for 200. This defines the element(s) to which a set of CSS rules apply.

**Kevin Ball:** What is a selector?

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct! Finally, selector is in the answer! \[laughter\] That brings you up to 7,000. Alright, go for it, Jake.

**Jake Dohm:** Okay, I'll take JS Frameworks for 200.

**Emma Bostian:** I somehow knew you were going there. I hope you get this one right... This library was developed by Facebook in 2013, and is still the most popular JavScript library.

**Jake Dohm:** What is React?

**Emma Bostian:** That is absolutely correct.

**Kevin Ball:** Popular by what dimension? I think jQuery is still on more websites.

**Jake Dohm:** \[laughs\] Ooh...

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, we're not doing this right now... \[laughter\]

**Kevin Ball:** No, it is the most popular among current developers. It's just the law of legacy...

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, I don't mean popular in terms of usage necessarily, I mean in terms of likability.

**Kevin Ball:** Oh, likability... Now, there - I don't know if React is gonna win on that, but... Usefulness, or usability...

**Emma Bostian:** Well...

**Kevin Ball:** ...being used... I don't know. I've been having to use React recently, and I'm telling you, it's making Vue look better every day.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, it is. Kball, we've got two categories left. Do you want JavScript again, or Even More JavScript?

**Kevin Ball:** Well, let's go with Even More JavScript then.

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\] Let's do it... Okay, your last question - this method tells the user agent that if the event is not explicitly handled, its default action should not be taken as normally would be.

**Kevin Ball:** What is prevent default?

**Emma Bostian:** \{51:59\} That is correct, prevent default. I don't know if it's default or default. I never know how to pronounce it... Alright. Okay, Jake, take it home - JavScript again, for 200. This is the very last question before we get to the super-final round, which is literally just one question. Okay, JavScript again for 200.

**Jake Dohm:** Alright.

**Emma Bostian:** This data type holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys.

**Jake Dohm:** What is an object?

**Emma Bostian:** No. Kball, you look like you know it.

**Kevin Ball:** I wanna go with "What is a map?"

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct.

**Jake Dohm:** Oh, a map... There you go.

**Emma Bostian:** That is correct.

**Kevin Ball:** It's that insertion order thing.

**Jake Dohm:** I was like... it can't be set again. Yeah, yeah... That's a good steal.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, so here's where we're at - Jake, you've got 8,100 points. Kball, you have 7,400 points. There's one final question, and I'm gonna need you to each write in the chat, the public JS Party chat right now, how many points you're wagering on this answer. You can wager nothing, and just take it and run, or you could bet it all, and who knows - Kball, you might come out on top. So write in your chat, final Jeopardy, how many points you are staking on this answer.

**Kevin Ball:** Do we write it before we know the question.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah...

**Jake Dohm:** Is this supposed to go on the Slack chat?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, it is. Are you not in it? I'll post yours for you, Jake. Just tell me how much you wanna bet.

**Jake Dohm:** Sweet, okay. Let's see... Should I just go for it all? That's a hard one.

**Emma Bostian:** You can, but it would ensure that you win. Kball, do you know how much you're gonna bet? Are you going all or nothing?

**Kevin Ball:** Do we have to let the other person know? \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** Well, otherwise you're gonna change your answers. \[laughs\]

**Kevin Ball:** Yeah, let's each Slack them to Emma.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, you each Slack me your answers, and then...

**Jake Dohm:** Alright, I'm sending it to you in the Zoom chat privately here.

**Emma Bostian:** Perfect. Perfect. And then I have to do more math additions, which is really not my strong suit.

**Kevin Ball:** Let's just go for it.

**Jake Dohm:** Do we both get a shot at this last question, or is it like whoever gets it first?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, you do. You both get a shot. I don't know how to make this objective, to where you both... One of you I think has to say it first.

**Kevin Ball:** We've gotta write it to you, so that we can't change it, and then we each read our answer?

**Emma Bostian:** Okay, yeah. Alright. So Kball, you send me your answer in Slack; Jake, you send your answer to me in the Zoom chat. Here's the final question - this is the year that JavScript was created.

**Jake Dohm:** Unbelievable. This is hard.

**Kevin Ball:** Oh, shoot.

**Jake Dohm:** Is it gonna be whoever gets closest here?

**Emma Bostian:** No, absolutely not. \[laughter\] Jake, you can't bet way more than you have. \[laughter\]

**Jake Dohm:** I'll bet the whole of them. I'm betting all of them.

**Emma Bostian:** \{55:07\} Alright. Welcome to the game where the rules don't matter. That's a different game.

**Jake Dohm:** \[laughs\]

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, I need your answers, please. What year was JavScript invented?

**Kevin Ball:** Alright, we'll try that.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay. Give me two seconds to tally it up. Someone sing something...

**Jake Dohm:** \[laughter\]

**Kevin Ball:** \[whistling\]

**Jake Dohm:** Not bad.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, here's where we landed. The question was "This is the year JavScript was created." The answer was 1995. Which means Kball has won...

**Jake Dohm:** No...

**Emma Bostian:** He came in at 14,799 points. Jake bet 100,000, which was not allowed, and ended up with -91,900 points. \[laughter\]

**Jake Dohm:** Unbelievable.

**Emma Bostian:** So with that, that is a wrap. Kball has won JS Jeopardy, and I don't have a prize for you other than...

**Kevin Ball:** Bragging rights?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, that's about it.

**Jake Dohm:** Congrats, Kball. You had a really great run there.

**Kevin Ball:** \[laughs\] I can't believe I got that right, 1995.

**Jake Dohm:** I know. I did 1997. I was close(ish).

**Emma Bostian:** I was two years old.

**Kevin Ball:** I was just -- oh, that makes me feel old. I was trying to remember... Because it was Netscape, right? Netscape Navigator...

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah.

**Kevin Ball:** And I was trying to remember when I first got a browser, and things like that, but...

**Jake Dohm:** Wow.

**Emma Bostian:** In any case... As a last closing note, to Kball's point, if you're an interviewer, please don't ask these questions. But if you're interviewing, these are all really great concepts for you to know... And try to love. \[laughter\] With that, thank you again, Jake, for coming on. It was an absolute pleasure. I'm looking forward to seeing you in Amsterdam, at Vue.js Amsterdam. I don't know, is JS Party showing up there at all? I don't believe so...

**Kevin Ball:** I don't know, but if not, maybe you should reach out to them and see... If you're gonna be there, Emma, reach out and say "Hey, can I host a show?"

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, absolutely. I'll get back to you on that. That sounds like fun.

**Kevin Ball:** And if they wanna fly somebody else in - I mean, hey...

**Emma Bostian:** That's true.

**Jake Dohm:** We know a guy.

**Emma Bostian:** Awesome. Well, I hope that everyone listening has a great day and is not terrified of me or of technical questions... And with that, I hope everyone has a great Thursday.

**Kevin Ball:** Thanks, Emma. Thanks, Jake. Thanks, Chris.

**Jake Dohm:** See ya!
