**Jerod Santo:** Hello, and welcome. I am Jerod Santo, and we're happy to be participating once again in HalfStack Online. If you attended the last time around, you may or may not have seen us play JS Danger. That's our don't-call-it-Jeopardy game show. What you're about to witness is our don't-call-it-Family-Feud game show. Those familiar with the American television game show will know how the game works, but for everyone else, this is how we play.

We have surveyed 112 JS Party listeners, and asked them various questions about frontend development, life as a developer, stuff like that... And our participants here are two teams who will battle to try to match as many surveys as possible. So we are split up into teams... We have team Emma, and because HalfStack is Halloween-themed this time around, our team names are also Halloween-themed. Emma, please introduce your team name and the members of your team.

**Emma Bostian:** Hello, everyone. I'm Emma and we are Team Boooooleans... I hate saying that loud. It sounded better in writing. But anyway, I am joined by the lovely Divya. Divya, do you want to say hello?

**Divya:** Hellooooooooo!

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\] And I'm also joined by a guest team member, Neil.

**Neil Roberts:** Hi! It's an honor just to be nominated. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well, the pleasure is all yours, Neil. We also have Nick here as well. Now, Emma's team actually won Frontend Feud last time around, but Nick's team also won, because Nick, you were on Emma's team last time. So we have two returning champs, but now you're forced to do battle. Nick, please introduce your team name and your team members.

**Nick Nisi:** Thank you, Jerod. Yes, we are Team Whiteboard Interviews.

**Jerod Santo:** Spooky...! That is scary.

**Nick Nisi:** And on my team today is Amal. Amal, how's it going?

**Amal Hussein:** Hi! I'm still laughing from Neil's joke. I'm gonna steal that one. It is an honor indeed just to be nominated. \[laughter\]

**Nick Nisi:** Indeed. And we also have a special guest, and that is Jem Young. Jem, would you like to introduce yourself?

**Jem Young:** Hello! Thanks, Nick, and thanks for having me on. I just wanna say, you're gonna regret having me on your team. Just letting you know that... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** \{04:15\} We already do... Alright, well let's feud, shall we? First up in the battle round -- the battle round works with two contestants, one from each team, comes up and tries to match the highest surveyed response. Whoever goes highest on the board gets to win the board, and they can either play or pass. First up, we have team captains Emma versus Nick. Step right up...

You will buzz in when you think you have an answer. You can buzz in by saying "Buzz!", "Bzz!", "FizzBuzz!", or any sound that makes me think that you buzzed. Are you ready?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Name something frontend devs complain about.

**Nick Nisi:** Buzz!

**Emma Bostian:** Buzz!

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, shoot, that was a simultaneous buzz. I'm gonna give it to Emma, because she said it louder.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm gonna say meetings.

**Jerod Santo:** Survey says... \[fail sound\]

**Emma Bostian:** Seriously?!

**Amal Hussein:** Oh... Yeah, you know what? I think that was a really good answer, but I feel like I'm gonna channel my inner grandma. I think we can nail this one, team...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Nick, now it defaults to you. What is something that frontend devs complain about?

**Amal Hussein:** Everything. Just kidding. \[laughter\]

**Divya:** Amal... It's not your turn... \[laughs\]

**Amal Hussein:** Wives... Just joking.

**Jerod Santo:** Sorry, Nick? Say it again, Nick? I can't hear you.

**Nick Nisi:** I said code.

**Jerod Santo:** Code... Not quite specific enough. I'm not gonna give that to you. \[fail sound\] Back to Emma... This is starting like the last game.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay, real quick though, Jerod... Before I say my answer, we have to quarantine Amal, if she's gonna keep saying things... Because to be fair, that could have been one of the answers. Just saying. I don't play dirty.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Amal, please stay in your corner until you're called upon.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay. Sorry. You have to understand, everybody, I am the child of African immigrants. We don't really do good with rules. We make our own rules in my house, okay...? \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** We might have to introduce a mute button. Okay. Emma, back to you?

**Emma Bostian:** How about non-semantic HTML? \[fail sound\] Okay, whoever you're interviewing is a terrible developer...

**Jerod Santo:** I'm sorry, but you guys are being way too specific...

**Nick Nisi:** This is going about as well as the last time.

**Divya:** You said he wasn't specific enough...

**Jerod Santo:** This is exactly how the last game started... Oh, is that what I said? \[laughter\] Nick, back to you... Please, save us. Well, it's just a battle round; one of you two have to hit one, and then we'll go to the rest of the players. Come on, Nick. You can do it.

**Amal Hussein:** Do we have a question for how many engineers does it take to figure out this game? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** This is 112 people... Surely, you can match some of them. Name something frontend devs complain about, Nick, please... Please, name something.

**Nick Nisi:** Co-workers.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, goodness... I'm not gonna give that one to you either. \[fail sound\]

**Jem Young:** Oh, come on, Nick. I have so many!

**Jerod Santo:** You're really close this time. You're really close this time. Alright, Emma, back to you.

**Amal Hussein:** I think it must be all that TypeScript... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Cheap shots from your own team... \[laughter\]

**Nick Nisi:** We're a family...

**Amal Hussein:** Sorry.

**Emma Bostian:** How about their manager?

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail sound\] I'll say that one just missed the board. It's not on there, but you're right on tight.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, man... It's back to me.

**Jerod Santo:** We have five things on the board...

**Emma Bostian:** Do I need to get \[unintelligible 00:07:24.26\]

**Jem Young:** Who made them captain...? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Name something that frontend developers complain about.

**Amal Hussein:** Whose turn is it?

**Emma Bostian:** No, no, no!

**Jerod Santo:** This is Nick versus Emma here. \[laughter\]

**Nick Nisi:** Something that frontend developers complain about. They complain about JavScript.

**Jerod Santo:** \[win sound\] Correct!

**Divya:** That's Stockholm syndrome...

**Emma Bostian:** Arrghh! I have Stockholm syndrome. I live here. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** \{07:54\} So 15 people said either JavScript, or JavScript fatigue, something along those lines... And that's correct. So you win the board, and you can now either play or pass. There are five things on the board. That was the number two answer. So you have one, three, four and five, and you have three strikes for your team to name those other four answers. Will you play or pass?

**Nick Nisi:** Let's play.

**Jerod Santo:** You're gonna play, okay. So we go from Nick to Jim... Jem, name something that frontend devs complain about.

**Jem Young:** Can I say frameworks?

**Jerod Santo:** Survey says... \[fail sound\] No, you cannot say frameworks. That's 1x.

**Jem Young:** Aww...

**Emma Bostian:** You were so confident.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, now we go to Amal. Amal, it's your turn. Welcome. \[laughter\]

**Divya:** Amal has a long list...

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, so many things... Um, I would say styling CSS.

**Jerod Santo:** Survey says... \[win sound\]

**Emma Bostian:** Number one answer.

**Divya:** Nice!

**Jem Young:** Nice...

**Jerod Santo:** Number three answer, with 14 responses.

**Divya:** Amal's not happy about that at all...

**Emma Bostian:** That was gonna be my next answer...

**Jerod Santo:** The number one, number four and number five answer are still on the board. We're back to Nick, and your team has one strike, so you have two more strikes to give. Nick?

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, man... Let's see. They complain about their editor.

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail sound\] I'm sorry, that did not make the cut. You now have two strikes, which means the game is in Jem's hands. Jem?

**Jem Young:** Oh...

**Jerod Santo:** Last strike.

**Jem Young:** No pressure.

**Jerod Santo:** No pressure.

**Jem Young:** This is where I live for. Something frontend devs complain about... What do I complain about? Everything. But specifically frontend... I'm gonna go with writing tests.

**Jerod Santo:** Survey says... \[fail sound\] No...!

**Jem Young:** Aww...! You bum frontend devs not writing tests!

**Jerod Santo:** Hey, how can you complain about it when you never do it? \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** That was good. That was a solid answer.

**Jem Young:** Thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so now Team Boooooleans gets a chance to steal.

**Divya:** You've got this, Emma...

**Jerod Santo:** You have one guess...

**Emma Bostian:** No, it's us. It's us.

**Divya:** Oh, it's us?

**Jerod Santo:** The team can confer. Yes, you get one guess.

**Neil Roberts:** I was thinking build tools.

**Divya:** I was gonna say WebPack, actually...

**Emma Bostian:** Let's do it.

**Amal Hussein:** Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. We can confer with our team?

**Jerod Santo:** No, the other team is stealing from your team. Your team is done.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay.

**Emma Bostian:** Amal, if you get all three wrong, we get a chance to steal it, we can talk about it, and then we give one answer. And if we get it right, we steal it all.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, so you talk about it. I see.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** They can only talk about it at the end, on the steal. And you get one guess.

**Amal Hussein:** Got it, got it.

**Jerod Santo:** So what are you going with here?

**Divya:** WebPack...

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, build tools/WebPack.

**Jerod Santo:** Survey says... \[fail sound\] No...

**Divya:** Come on, really?!

**Neil Roberts:** I spend 90% of my time doing that.

**Jem Young:** That was a good one.

**Divya:** Oh, my gosh...

**Jerod Santo:** So the Team Whiteboard Interviews keeps their 29 points that they've scored. The number one answer, which nobody guessed, which will sound super-obvious in retrospect, is browser/IE/Safari compatibility etc.

**Jem Young:** Arrgh...!

**Neil Roberts:** This isn't 1999...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Tell that to the survey respondents... The number four thing that frontend devs complain about is backend devs, with \[unintelligible 00:10:54.06\]

**Amal Hussein:** Wow, that's some serious shade...

**Divya:** Really?! Wow, that's shade...

**Jerod Santo:** And now we come full circle, because the number five answer - I heard it twice mentioned as a joke - they complain about everything. There are six people that complain about everything.

**Divya:** Oh, my god... That's so general.

**Jerod Santo:** So those are the ones missed... Bosses and managers barely missed the board; there were six responses. Three people complained about Npm, two about WebPack, one about Vim, one about JIRA, one about lack of respect... So there's a few other answers.

**Divya:** Okay...

**Jem Young:** These are really \[unintelligible 00:11:28.10\]

**Divya:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** So that is round one... We now go to round two. It's going to be our guests, Neil versus Jem. Gentlemen, step right up.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, Neil, get your buzz ready.

**Nick Nisi:** So did we get points for that round?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, you got 19 points.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah.

**Amal Hussein:** Neil, just channel your inner frontend dev that doesn't exist. \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** Buzz as loudly as you can, even if you don't know the answer.

**Jerod Santo:** Name something you might do on a Zoom meeting.

**Jem Young:** Buzz.

**Jerod Santo:** Jem, you buzzed in...

**Emma Bostian:** Neil, you had one job... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Jem buzzed in immediately...

**Jem Young:** Something you do in a Zoom meeting would be tell someone that they're muted.

**Jerod Santo:** \{12:11\} Survey says... \[win sound\] Number one answer, with 22.

**Nick Nisi:** Nice...

**Amal Hussein:** Nice job.

**Jerod Santo:** This covers both people who responded with muting and unmuting. So now both of those are gone. And since that was the number one answer, your team wins the board, and now you can just play or pass. Neil actually does not get a guess, so does team Whiteboard Interviews like to play this round or pass?

**Jem Young:** What do you think, team?

**Amal Hussein:** I think we can give it a whirl. We have nothing to lose.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so you guys are playing. We go to Amal. Amal, there are six total answers on the board. Jem has named the number one answer, so there's five more left. What is something you might do on a Zoom meeting?

**Amal Hussein:** I would say screenshare...

**Jerod Santo:** Survey says... \[fail sound\]

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, no...!

**Jerod Santo:** It did not make the cut...

**Amal Hussein:** Okay... Wow. That's a surprise.

**Emma Bostian:** Before we continue, I want Neil to know he's been unnominated... \[laughter\] No, I'm sorry. I'm throwing shade. I'm just kidding.

**Divya:** It's a moonlight moment... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** The pleasure is all his... Alright, Nick, word to you. You've got one strike, and there's five things left on the board.

**Nick Nisi:** Okay... There's an answer I want to give, but I don't think it's on there... I'm gonna say "Drink." \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Survey says... \[fail sound\] No.

**Divya:** Really?!

**Jerod Santo:** Not even close. Okay, back to Jem. Apparently, the only one who's good at this round... Jem?

**Divya:** We're all drinking on this call; I just thought I'd say that though...

**Emma Bostian:** Some of us have more adult beverages than others... It's fine.

**Divya:** Excuse me... I will have you know that coffee and tea is an adult beverage.

**Emma Bostian:** Fair enough...

**Jerod Santo:** So is water...

**Amal Hussein:** It's a beverage for real adults...

**Divya:** So is water.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes... Jem, please name something on the board.

**Jem Young:** I just wanna say that the hate that I have for Emma is powering my answers right now... \[laughter\] I just want you to know that.

**Emma Bostian:** Really? Because in the first round you got it wrong. Just saying.

**Jem Young:** We just won the board already, so...

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, just tell us your answer, SmartyPants.

**Neil Roberts:** You have 20-something points. That's a lot, right?

**Jem Young:** So something that people do on a Zoom meeting - I'm gonna say "Forget to turn off their video."

**Jerod Santo:** Survey says... \[win sound\] Number two answer, with 11 responses. Now, that covers both camera off and camera on. So some people say "Turn it off"/"Turn it on"/"Forget to..." etc.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** So that's the number one--

**Jem Young:** My shoulder is so heavy with the burden that I'm carrying right now for my team... I'm just carrying my team on the back right now... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, Amal, it's time for you to--

**Amal Hussein:** Wow, Jem. Alright.

**Emma Bostian:** Way to burn bridges.

**Jerod Santo:** ...to participate here.

**Amal Hussein:** Alright, yeah. Let's see, so what do people do on Zoom? So they mute and unmute, turn their camera on and off... They clearly don't screenshare, apparently... I don't know... I guess I'm the only one doing work on Zoom. \[laughter\] I don't know, I'm gonna put a wild thing out there, which is like "Play with their virtual backgrounds/Change their backgrounds", or whatever...

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, solid.

**Jerod Santo:** Survey says... \[win sounds\] Number four answer.

**Emma Bostian:** Solid answer.

**Jem Young:** Nice, nice.

**Amal Hussein:** Whoa, okay. Alright, thanks.

**Jerod Santo:** That's worth nine points...

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, very nice, Neil.

**Emma Bostian:** Is that Sweden?!

**Neil Roberts:** I had it queued up for the steal.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, that would have been great.

**Emma Bostian:** it's like the Swedish Royal Palace.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah. You get points, Neil.

**Neil Roberts:** \[unintelligible 00:15:20.10\]

**Jerod Santo:** Nick, we are back to you. There's two strikes, and there are three answers left on the board.

**Neil Roberts:** No pressure.

**Emma Bostian:** No pressure... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** What do people do on a Zoom meeting?

**Nick Nisi:** They chat.

**Jerod Santo:** \[win sound\] Correct!

**Amal Hussein:** Wow...

**Jerod Santo:** Number three answer.

**Emma Bostian:** We're just listing Zoom features at this point... \[laughter\]

**Nick Nisi:** We play Frontend Feud...

**Neil Roberts:** Sponsored by Zoom...

**Jerod Santo:** Sponsored by Zoom, yeah... \[laughter\]

**Amal Hussein:** My next answer, "They only pay $15/month."

**Jerod Santo:** Right. Zoom doesn't need to sponsor. They're already everywhere. Okay, we're down to the last two, number five and number six, so it's gonna get a little harder here. We have one more strike. Back to you, Jem. You're two for two right now; can you deliver?

**Jem Young:** Hm...

**Amal Hussein:** \{16:04\} You're the best frontend developer ever, Jem... \[laughter\]

**Jem Young:** I know. What does that say about the state of frontend development...? \[laughter\] Something people do on a Zoom meeting... I guess for five and six we have to get meta, so I'm gonna say "Complain about video chat meetings."

**Divya:** No way...

**Jerod Santo:** Survey says... \[fail sound\] Not on the board.

**Neil Roberts:** That was good. I liked that.

**Jem Young:** Too meta, too meta.

**Jerod Santo:** That's three strikes...

**Emma Bostian:** I have an idea for the steal... What about asking if they can see my screen when screensharing? Like, "Can you see my screen?"

**Divya:** That's a good one.

**Neil Roberts:** I was also thinking screen recording.

**Divya:** Yeah, same. I was thinking "Is it recording?"

**Neil Roberts:** Because I was listing their features...

**Divya:** ...as a question. Because everyone asks that.

**Amal Hussein:** I think you guys are going down a dangerous path.

**Emma Bostian:** I don't think so... Because screenshare is an action, and asking if someone can see your screen is a completely different thing.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay, okay...

**Jerod Santo:** Is that your guys' final--

**Divya:** But was that related to the screen--

**Amal Hussein:** If this one gets it, Jerod, I'm just letting you know, I'm gonna contest...

**Divya:** No, but screenshare was mentioned already... So if that was not a subset of the previous one... I think Jerod assumes that if you say a word that's a subset of a larger word, it counts...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, I'll group together \[unintelligible 00:17:11.16\]

**Emma Bostian:** Okay, fine.

**Divya:** Yeah, so it's not screensharing.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay... So I guess, Divya, you're probably right then.

**Divya:** Neil said the same thing. Neil and I are on the same frequency.

**Neil Roberts:** \[laughs\] She's right, she's right. We're throwing shade at me, so I'm good. \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** Neil was unnominated...

**Amal Hussein:** Wait, Emma, don't you need Amal \[unintelligible 00:17:23.17\] I'm only saving you guys from this...

**Jem Young:** Stop helping them!

**Amal Hussein:** Sorry, sorry.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, seriously, Amal... Whose team are you on?

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, okay. Sharing is caring. I'm on everybody's team. I'm a platform engineer! Just kidding.

**Jerod Santo:** What's your final answer, Team Boooooleans?

**Emma Bostian:** Screen recording.

**Jerod Santo:** Screen recording. And survey says... \[fail sound\] No. You've missed the steal.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay, can we--

**Divya:** I think just are not aware of all the features that Zoom offers. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well, the survey didn't list out all the things...

**Amal Hussein:** Open up the Zoom preferences tab, everybody... \[laughter\]

**Nick Nisi:** You should have said "They quit after 40 minutes."

**Jerod Santo:** The number five answer was "Check Twitter/Check crypto/Surf the web..." Basically, surf the web and do other things.

**Amal Hussein:** Not pay attention, yeah. That's what I thought.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. And then the number six answer was actually "Work." They just said "Work."

**Jem Young:** What?!

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, they work.

**Jem Young:** People work on Zoom...?!

**Emma Bostian:** I just wanna publicly state that your team is not winning because you get the answers right, you're winning because no one's getting anything right.

**Jerod Santo:** Hm... That's meta.

**Neil Roberts:** I think we got a lot of points last round, if we're counting...

**Emma Bostian:** Actually, that's on you, Jerod; or the public, actually... I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** I didn't come up with the answers, I just came up with the questions. So four people answered "Zone one/Sleep/ Take a nap", two people said "Don't wear pants", two people said "Cry", one person said "Play the ukulele", "Show off my cat" was another common answer, and then "Check my pores", which I thought was really kind of morbid, but anyways...

**Emma Bostian:** What?!

**Jem Young:** Weird.

**Divya:** That's really weird... Also, I don't think the fidelity is high enough for that... Is it? I don't think so.

**Jerod Santo:** You're real technical on that...

**Divya:** I feel like I'm always washed out on Zoom. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, my goodness... Nick, you just went super-zoom-in on your face... You have very nice pores.

**Nick Nisi:** I'm checking my pores.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. What kind of lotion do you use? That's nice.

**Divya:** Oh, it's too close...

**Jerod Santo:** So after two rounds, team Nick, a.k.a. Whiteboard Millionaires -- what's your team name? The Whiteboard Interviews? \[laughter\] Whiteboard Millionaires... I like that one better.

**Emma Bostian:** Whiteboard Millionaires... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah... Has 81. And Team Boooooleans has zerooooo... Okay.

**Jem Young:** Ooohh...

**Nick Nisi:** Boooo...

**Break:** \{19:42\}

**Jerod Santo:** Divya and Amal, you are now to battle off in our next round... Please step up to the board...

**Amal Hussein:** I have to battle my friend... This is so sad.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. Are you ready?

**Divya:** We put our friendship to the test...

**Amal Hussein:** I know.

**Divya:** We already have enemies on this call, so... We'll see where we end up. \[laughter\]

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, name something you learned, but never used in practice.

**Amal Hussein:** Buzz.

**Divya:** Buzz.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, Amal buzzed in first.

**Amal Hussein:** I'm gonna say complex -- a lot of frontend engineers are probably not doing a lot of data sciency... Not data sciency; they're not using a lot of data structures. So I would say data structures, algorithms, red-black trees... That whole genre of stuff.

**Jem Young:** Good answer, good answer.

**Jerod Santo:** I'm gonna interpret that as data structures, and I'm gonna say... \[win sound\] That is the number two answer.

**Jem Young:** Nice.

**Amal Hussein:** Boom!

**Jerod Santo:** Linked in that is link lists, B-trees etc.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, that's what I was thinking, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Yup. So 13 people responded that. You have number two, but the number one is still on the board, so that means Divya does have a chance to name it, and she can steal the board.

**Divya:** Ooff... The question was around -- can you say the question again?

**Jerod Santo:** Name something you learned, but never used in practice.

**Divya:** Data structures was already mentioned... Algorithms, I think. That's the next one.

**Jerod Santo:** Algorithms. Survey says... \[win sound\] Number one answer.

**Divya:** Yeahhhh!

**Amal Hussein:** Hey, you know I said algorithms, right? I was like "Data structures, algorithms..."

**Emma Bostian:** You shouted a bunch of stuff... \[laughter\] You said a lot.

**Jerod Santo:** You named like six things. I had to go with the first thing.

**Emma Bostian:** The one time you should have said everything, you didn't; and the one time you should have, you did. \[laughs\]

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, yeah... You know what, Emma? Thanks... \[laughter\] That's okay.

**Jerod Santo:** So Divya's team steals the board. I assume, since you guys haven't played yet, you wanna play this board? Team Divya and Emma?

**Divya:** Yeah, why not.

**Emma Bostian:** What do we have to lose, zero? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So there's four total answers on the board. You already have the number one and the number two answers... So you're trying to hit three and four, and you have all three strikes to go... So we will go to now Emma. Your turn.

**Emma Bostian:** How about recursion?

**Jerod Santo:** Recursion. Survey says... \[win sound\] Yes, that's the number four answer.

**Divya:** Very nice!

**Jem Young:** Nice!

**Jerod Santo:** Very nice. Five points there. You now have all but one...

**Emma Bostian:** We're coming for you... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** And you've got all the three strikes to waste. We now go to Neil... Name something you learned, but never used in practice.

**Neil Roberts:** Oh, I don't know... Probably that's wrong... I studied computer engineering...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, lots of stuff then.

**Neil Roberts:** Machine code is one thing I learned, that I never used.

**Jerod Santo:** Is that your answer?

**Neil Roberts:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Survey says... \[fail sound\] Nope.

**Emma Bostian:** That's a solid point though... If you learn computer science, it'll generally teach you Assembly language.

**Neil Roberts:** Yeah, something like that.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, not a bad guess at all. But a strike nonetheless. We now go back to Divya, trying to hit that last number three...

**Divya:** Oh, man... He is on... Hm. Functional programming.

**Jerod Santo:** Functional programming. And the survey says...

**Amal Hussein:** A thousand fairies just died.... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail sound\]

**Divya:** I was gonna say Elm, but I didn't wanna throw a shade, so... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Okay... So not on there, functional programming, but there is one answer left, and we're back to Emma.

**Emma Bostian:** I was gonna guess that, for what it's worth... How about PHP?

**Jerod Santo:** PHP. Survey says... \[fail sound\] No.

**Divya:** Nooooo...!

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, now it's time for the other team to steal.

**Nick Nisi:** Memory management.

**Jerod Santo:** Nick's team - y'all have one guess. Go ahead.

**Nick Nisi:** What do you think about memory management?

**Jem Young:** Nah... How many answers are left? Two or one?

**Jerod Santo:** \{24:07\} Just one. The number three answer is the only one left.

**Jem Young:** Oh, okay.

**Amal Hussein:** Memory management, yeah...

**Jem Young:** Nah...

**Amal Hussein:** Things that you have to learn...

**Jem Young:** I would say Java... No, seriously.

**Emma Bostian:** I thought you said JavScript, and I was like "Huh...!" \[laughter\]

**Neil Roberts:** That would be a good answer.

**Amal Hussein:** I don't know, maybe some statically-typed language. I would say if we can broaden that to a statically-typed language of some kind.

**Jem Young:** I'm good with that.

**Amal Hussein:** Are you good? Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** So Java? Or any statically-typed language?

**Amal Hussein:** Any.

**Jerod Santo:** Or Java.

**Divya:** It's so broad...

**Jem Young:** We can go with any. It's broader.

**Amal Hussein:** Well, broader...

**Jerod Santo:** I guess I don't know why I'm drilling down, because they're both wrong. \[fail sound\] \[laughter\]

**Jem Young:** Oh, Jerod...! You set us off so well... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** So the number three answer - and this does not bode well for our industry...

**Emma Bostian:** If they say CSS, I swear--

**Jerod Santo:** People learn, but never use it in practice - testing/TDD.

**Divya:** Really?! \[unintelligible 00:25:00.27\]

**Jem Young:** Shame on all of you. Shame.

**Jerod Santo:** Write some tests, y'all. Write some tests.

**Emma Bostian:** I was gonna say that, but I think Kent C. Dodds would have just curled over...

**Jerod Santo:** Ten people answered this... We should probably unleash him on these people. So a few other answers - Haskell, ERD diagrams, Big O notation, "my entire CS degree", which was kind of... \[laughter\] And then the real curious one, deodorant.

**Divya:** What?! \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** Whoever submitted that, I love them.

**Jerod Santo:** So team Emma is now on the board. It's 33 to 81. They're right back in it, and we now go on to round--

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, Emma's like, "Back from the dead."

**Jerod Santo:** ...four!

**Divya:** Boooooleans...!

**Jerod Santo:** Back from the dead, and we're back to Emma and Nick. Step right up. Name something developers put on their website.

**Nick Nisi:** Buzz.

**Emma Bostian:** Buzz!

**Jerod Santo:** Nick got it first.

**Emma Bostian:** That's not true. I'm in Sweden, I have a lag on my connection. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Just because you're louder doesn't mean you're first. Nick squeezed it in there.

**Nick Nisi:** I'm trying to be loud... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Go ahead, Nick.

**Nick Nisi:** Something they put on their website... I'm gonna say their resume.

**Jerod Santo:** Their resume... \[fail sound\]

**Nick Nisi:** Really?!

**Jem Young:** Oh...! That's pretty good.

**Divya:** Oh, I guess not.

**Jerod Santo:** There's five answers on the board... Emma, it's back to you. Go ahead.

**Emma Bostian:** Hm... I guess I'm gonna go safe, just to hopefully steal the board... I'm gonna go with contact information.

**Jerod Santo:** That one I will give to you. \[win sound\] Contact form, or how to contact me, yes.

**Divya:** Yaay!

**Jerod Santo:** So that is the number three answer. But since Nick missed altogether...

**Emma Bostian:** I didn't think it would be number one, yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** ...you are on the board, and you can play or pass.

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, we're playing.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So we now go to Neil. Name something developers put on their website.

**Neil Roberts:** A link to their GitHub.

**Jerod Santo:** A link to their GitHub. Survey says... \[win sound\] Number one answer.

**Jem Young:** Yeah!

**Divya:** Nice...

**Emma Bostian:** So that's what I was gonna say, but I wasn't sure if people said the portfolio was their GitHub, or if it was not.

**Divya:** Yeah, that's a good point.

**Jerod Santo:** The answers in this were GitHub, or social links... Anybody that says links to Twitter and social sites was all that one big thing. That's the number one answer with 33. So we still have two, four and five available, and we are now to Divya.

**Divya:** Interesting. Hm... I'm thinking copyright information.

**Jerod Santo:** Is copyright information--

**Divya:** But I don't know if that's too-- \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Wait a second, was that your answer? Or did you just read my face and try to change it?

**Divya:** No, it's not. I just thought I'd think out loud, you know...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, okay.

**Divya:** You know, like whiteboarding, kind of thing...

**Jerod Santo:** Right, right, right... I feel like you're reading my face and then you just change it as I begin to \[unintelligible 00:27:40.23\]

**Divya:** No, no, no. I was thinking out loud. Also, your face has told us nothing so far...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, good.

**Divya:** You've led us on many times to believe we were on the right track... \[laughter\] So I believe nothing.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, good. I feel like I'm doing my job then.

**Divya:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** So...

**Divya:** What do they have on their websites? Probably a blog.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me blog... \[win sound\] Yup, number five answer - blog, or blog posts, with five responses.

**Divya:** The copyright thing - I've seen it in many places, they've written like "2019 Copyright", whatever... I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, for sure.

**Divya:** \{28:12\} Maybe I just follow people with that.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, we have two answers left, and we are back to Emma.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, I'm torn between two, but I think I will go for "information about themselves." Like an About section.

**Jerod Santo:** An About section. Survey says...

**Amal Hussein:** You mean a bio?

**Emma Bostian:** Yes! Thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail sound\]

**Jem Young:** I would have said bio, yeah.

**Amal Hussein:** I would have said bio, too.

**Jerod Santo:** It did not make the cut...

**Amal Hussein:** Where are these personal websites without bios? Who are these people?

**Divya:** I guess they assume they just know you. They're like, "You should know..." \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** You're talking about our listeners here. Remember, JS Party listeners filled this out, so...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, I was gonna say... Yeah, this is amazing. Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Remember that it doesn't mean their website doesn't have a bio; it's like, what's the first thing they think of when we ask them this question. You ask them the question, they answer... So it's like what they think of.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, I see, I see. Okay, what they think of.

**Jerod Santo:** So Neil - there's one strike, you've got two strikes left, and you have two answers on the board.

**Neil Roberts:** I'm gonna say a photo of them.

**Jerod Santo:** A photo. Survey says... \[fail sound\]

**Emma Bostian:** That was my other answer.

**Jerod Santo:** That's a good guess...

**Jem Young:** I would have said that, yeah. It's a good answer.

**Jerod Santo:** It's definitely--

**Neil Roberts:** You should have a photo on your website, people...

**Emma Bostian:** I think we need to stop thinking about portfolios as being a separate website.

**Divya:** Yeah, I think it might be just the same, included... I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, we are on to Divya... You had two strikes, so this will be your last guess, unless you get one correct.

**Divya:** Oh, my god... The pressure...

**Neil Roberts:** Copyright?

**Jem Young:** Copyright?

**Divya:** Yeah, I'm just gonna say copyright... \[laughter\] I don't even know at this point what people -- I mean, I don't have a lot of information on mine.

**Jerod Santo:** Are you gonna say copyright?

**Divya:** I'll go with that, why not... I don't care.

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail sound\]

**Amal Hussein:** It's the hopeless answer.

**Jerod Santo:** That's why \[unintelligible 00:29:46.16\]

**Emma Bostian:** \[unintelligible 00:29:48.08\] that you don't care, but also, you're so legally correct, and I love it... \[laughter\]

**Divya:** Yeah, I am. Everything's legally biding, you know...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, legally binding... \[laughter\]

**Divya:** I stand my ground. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Okay... Can the Whiteboard Millionaires steal? You have a chance to steal.

**Jem Young:** Whiteboard Millionaires, I love it. I feel like we're kind of losing some steam...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah...

**Jem Young:** Normally, I think my answer would be a link to my OnlyFans page... \[laughter\] But this is a family-friendly show, so I won't say that... But team, what do you think about saying projects? A link to projects.

**Amal Hussein:** Yes, yes. I was gonna say that.

**Jerod Santo:** Final answer?

**Nick Nisi:** Let's do it.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah.

**Nick Nisi:** Projects.

**Jerod Santo:** Survey says... \[win sound\]

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah...!

**Jerod Santo:** Number two answer.

**Divya:** Oh, I guess the portfolio one was right...

**Amal Hussein:** Boom!

**Jerod Santo:** Yup.

**Divya:** Actually, my portfolio is just the copyright.

**Amal Hussein:** Good job!

**Divya:** \[laughs\]

**Jem Young:** Do you see my shoulders from carrying so much of the weight of the team on the shoulders?

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, wow, wow... Okay... Okay...

**Emma Bostian:** Hopefully, you're not the one who forgot how to use deodorant, so.. \[laughter\]

**Jem Young:** It was also me. I filled out some of these answers, you should know that.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay... So after four rounds, team Emma has 33, and team Nick has 138, so it might be out of reach... But we are now gonna introduce a new round, which we call the Inverted Round. I learned about this from listener Alexy, who wrote in after our last Frontend Feud and said in Russia they have the same guy, although it's called 100 to 1 there... And they have this special round called the Inverted Round. There's no battle, but each team gets one response. The team who gets the lowest points gets to go first, which is team Emma.

What you're trying to do is name something on the board, but you wanna hit the bottom of the board, not the top. So the bottom is worth more points than the top.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, that's so cool, actually...

**Divya:** Yeah.

**Amal Hussein:** It's making you flex your brain in a different way.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. So there are four answers on the board, and you're shooting for the bottom.

**Emma Bostian:** It shouldn't be hard for us... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Name a web protocol that you're very familiar with. Now, remember, you're trying to find not the obvious answer, but the less obvious answers. There's four of them on the board, and we go to team Emma first.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay, so let's think about the obvious ones. The obvious ones are probably--

**Neil Roberts:** HTTP...

**Emma Bostian:** \{32:03\} Yeah, and TCP/IP probably... What other ones are there?

**Amal Hussein:** Are we talking about HTTP protocols, or...

**Jerod Santo:** Here's the exact--

**Jem Young:** Well, stop helping them.

**Amal Hussein:** I was curious. Okay... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** It says "Name a web protocol that you're very familiar with." That's what it said. So they can interpret that however they want.

**Neil Roberts:** That you ARE very familiar with.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**Emma Bostian:** So it's something that people generally aren't familiar with...

**Jerod Santo:** No, are.

**Neil Roberts:** Not necessarily... It's gonna be the fourth answer of the things that people are familiar with...

**Divya:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Correct.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, but look at the answers we've gotten thus far on this show. We have someone who doesn't use deodorant, someone who cries on Zoom, so... I mean...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Two people cry on Zoom.

**Jem Young:** All these are -- you're just describing Emma, yeah.

**Neil Roberts:** But I think we're just doing the top four, right?

**Jerod Santo:** That's right, top four. You have to get in the top four, but you wanna aim for the bottom.

**Divya:** Yeah, we have to start from the bottom.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**Divya:** Started from the bottom now we're here...

**Emma Bostian:** I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** So team Emma, please...

**Emma Bostian:** Those are the only two ones I know.

**Neil Roberts:** You can have HTTPS maybe...

**Divya:** What was the second one? Yeah, HTTP, I guess...

**Emma Bostian:** No, but I think TCP/IP is less known for web devs maybe... I don't know.

**Divya:** Yeah, that's probably fair...

**Emma Bostian:** Let's just go with that one.

**Neil Roberts:** WebSocket...? What about WebSocket?

**Divya:** I was thinking sockets, too. Sockets will be pretty low on the list as well.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, let's do that, sure.

**Jerod Santo:** What is your answer?

**Divya:** Neil?

**Neil Roberts:** WebSockets.

**Jerod Santo:** WebSockets. Is WebSockets on the board? \[win sound\] It sure is, and it's the number three answer, which means it's the number two answer...

**Emma Bostian:** Woo-hoo!

**Divya:** Okay, that's pretty nice!

**Jerod Santo:** ...which means it's worth 30 points. That's a very good answer. So you now have 63...

**Emma Bostian:** Still not caught up.

**Jerod Santo:** No, not caught up. Nick, Jem and Amal... Name a web protocol that you're very familiar with; remember, you're trying to hit the more obscure answer.

**Nick Nisi:** Should we go with secure WebSockets?

**Jem Young:** Well, I'll let you all go, and then I'll say what I -- and we'll see if we agree.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. What did you say there, Nick? Secure WebSockets?

**Nick Nisi:** I was joking, but yes... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Nick Nisi:** It's more obscure, right?

**Amal Hussein:** I would say HTTPS...

**Jem Young:** That's a good one, but I think it's up here...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah...

**Jem Young:** Can I hazard a guess? Can I say UDP? Yeah, yeah... \[unintelligible 00:34:13.23\] But I'm also open to HTTPs, because I think people don't know about it.

**Amal Hussein:** Did the other team do TCP already?

**Jerod Santo:** No, they did WebSockets.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay. I would say that -- yeah, I feel like I'm a little bit confused about this question though, because... You know, does this include HTTP protocols like GET, REST, POST, HEAD, whatever? Or is this -- you can't tell me right?

**Jerod Santo:** The thing is that it's however the reader interpreted the survey question. The way they interpret it, they answer it the way they read it, so...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah... I would almost say -- yeah, I'd wanna put like maybe DELETE, or I don't know... Like deletions, or something people don't do...

**Nick Nisi:** OPTIONS...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah. CORS... CORS flight is something also people don't do a lot... But I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Nick, you're team captain. You have to make the final call on this one. You have JEM's advice, he said UDP, Amal threw out a few things...

**Amal Hussein:** Jem's been like--

**Nick Nisi:** He's been on fire.

**Amal Hussein:** He's been on fire, so let's go with that.

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah, let's do it.

**Neil Roberts:** But I'm changing my answer; I like TCP/IP. I think it's a well-known web protocol, but I doubt people are familiar with it.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah.

**Neil Roberts:** But actually, that would be higher, so let's go lower. So I'll stick with UDP.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay.

**Nick Nisi:** Let's deal with the \[unintelligible 00:35:32.10\]

**Jerod Santo:** Final answer is UDP. Survey says... \[fail sound\] No. It did not even make the board. So the four answers... Number one, which ends up having the least amount of points, overwhelmingly, was HTTP, with 83 of the 112 who answered. Number two was WebSockets, which you guys got correct; that was worth 30 points. DNS was number three... And the lowest one, which is the highest one in points, is REST.

**Amal Hussein:** That's so weird...

**Divya:** Really?! So weird...!

**Jem Young:** Amal, you were in that direction.

**Amal Hussein:** Well, I was, but that's okay... You don't have to listen to me, Jem... \[laughs\]

**Jem Young:** \{36:14\} I assumed REST would be the most prominent answer...

**Divya:** Yeah, exactly. I thought it'd be way higher than HTTP...

**Amal Hussein:** Same.

**Jem Young:** I bet devs are not familiar with--

**Emma Bostian:** So Jem came in here with one rival, and left with five...

**Amal Hussein:** But REST - it's like a pattern.

**Divya:** Yeah, but people are familiar with GraphQL, and that's really popular... And GraphQL is essentially always talked about with reference to REST...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, I know... But I meant it like -- I thought it was more about actual web protocols... Like standard stuff.

**Divya:** I see, I see.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. You may have thought more deeply about the question than a lot of people taking the survey... \[laughter\] Remember, the survey have 25 questions and people are kind of cruising through them, so probably the first thing that comes to their head, "Bam, bam, bam!"

**Amal Hussein:** Right, right.

**Jerod Santo:** Anyways, Alexy, thanks for writing in about that one. That's cool, the Inverted Round. We'll keep that around. And after all rounds, the winning team -- the game is not over, but the winning team is Nick, with 138, the Whiteboard... It turns out they're millionaires after all... And the Boooooleans pulled up a zero, I guess, because they have 63 points - you know, false...

**Divya:** 63....

**Emma Bostian:** That's not funny. We had points.

**Jerod Santo:** Not funny. \[laughter\]

**Jem Young:** You had points, and lost them.

**Divya:** \[unintelligible 00:37:22.22\]

**Jerod Santo:** You can take your points with you.

**Divya:** Boooooleans also mean true, so it could be...

**Jerod Santo:** That's why I was trying to say false, like you lost... Anyways, it was dumb.

**Divya:** No, I don't like that.

**Emma Bostian:** It wasn't funny.

**Divya:** No.

**Nick Nisi:** It looks like I'm the common denominator...

**Jem Young:** I thought it was funny, Jerod... I thought it was funny.

**Divya:** Not false.

**Amal Hussein:** True Losers could be another name, you know...?

**Jerod Santo:** This is where I need to be more like Nick, and say my jokes quieter, so that people don't get them.

**Amal Hussein:** True Losers... \[laughter\]

**Break:** \{37:47\}

**Jerod Santo:** We now go to the final round. This is Fast Money Round. The way this round works is just the winning team - that's Nick, Jem and Amal - you pick two participants to do Fast Money. The way Fast Money Works is one of you goes in a cone of silence, the other one participates. I have five questions. You just try to hit the number one answer on each one. So it's a rapid-fire.

I'll say the question, the first thing that comes to your head; I'll say the next question, first thing that comes to your head. All the way down. And then we bring the person out of the cone of silence, they then get to go, and we add up your points total. If you get over 100, then you win Fast Money, which also equals zero, or false, because there's no money here; it's just all for bragging rights... But it's fun.

So Nick, who should be playing Fast Money Round for your team?

**Nick Nisi:** Does anyone not want to play?

**Amal Hussein:** I mean, I think it should be our star man...

**Jerod Santo:** I think the guest is an obvious choice there, since he's been carrying the weight...

**Jem Young:** I think I should sit this out, because --

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, no, no, no. No.

**Jem Young:** If we win based on my answers, and then of course we're gonna win again if I go... \[laughter\]

**Amal Hussein:** But there's nothing else to win...

**Jem Young:** Yeah, just more wins.

**Jerod Santo:** It's just more bragging rights, you know?

**Jem Young:** They'll just hear about it for the next year...

**Neil Roberts:** You'll be tired of our winning.

**Jem Young:** I will follow on the internet and be like "Remember that time when I carried you?"

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Jem Young:** So you don't want that from me.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Nick, you decide. Who's gonna play, and who's gonna sit?

**Emma Bostian:** Make Jem play.

**Amal Hussein:** I think it should be Nick...

**Jerod Santo:** Nick decides.

**Jem Young:** Nick and Amal.

**Amal Hussein:** No, no, no... I think it should be Nick, because --

**Nick Nisi:** Well, it's two of us, right?

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, there's two people?

**Jerod Santo:** Two people play, one person sits.

**Amal Hussein:** \{40:22\} Okay, fine. Then both of us. Yeah, that's fine.

**Emma Bostian:** They're gonna do so well, since they don't know the rules... It's gonna be great. \[laughter\]

**Amal Hussein:** You know, I feel like that was a backwards compliment... \[laughter\] You know what? Thanks! I don't follow rules. Yes, yes...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, you're gonna go second. So I'm gonna have you mute your microphone, and look into -- just open up Slack. Yeah, look into my eyes -- no, mute yourself; you can't listen, and you can't look. But just open your Slack DM with me. I'm gonna DM you when you're ready to come back, okay?

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, okay.

**Jerod Santo:** So you have to have complete silence.

**Amal Hussein:** So you mean like mute, and then you want me to not hear you at all?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, take off your headset, or whatever you have to do...

**Amal Hussein:** Okay, yeah, I can take off my headset.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, she's gone.

**Amal Hussein:** Sorry, I can take off my headset.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. And also mute your microphone, in case you're just like singing a song, or humming along, or whatever you do over there... \[laughter\]

**Amal Hussein:** I'm gonna mute my \[unintelligible 00:41:14.03\]

**Jem Young:** Can we not put her in a breakout room sponsored by Zoom? \[laughter\] That great feature that Zoom has, breakout rooms...

**Emma Bostian:** I'm actually surprised no one mentioned the breakout room. That is a good one.

**Jerod Santo:** That is a good Zoom feature, especially if you upgrade for just $15,99 a month. \[laughter\] Okay. Price and participation may vary. Um, alright...

**Nick Nisi:** Alright, so I'm going first?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Are you ready?

**Nick Nisi:** Yes.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Name a platform for learning frontend development.

**Nick Nisi:** Egghead.

**Jerod Santo:** Name something you might find in a commit message.

**Nick Nisi:** WIP.

**Jerod Santo:** Name something you associate with Silicon Valley.

**Nick Nisi:** Money.

**Jerod Santo:** Name a way to determine if code is bad.

**Nick Nisi:** Linting.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Name something that frontend developers might swap.

**Nick Nisi:** Editor configs.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Emma Bostian:** That was solid.

**Jem Young:** That was good, Nick.

**Jerod Santo:** Good job, Nick.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, that was really good.

**Jem Young:** Way to be a captain. So proud of you.

**Jerod Santo:** Let me send Amal a DM to get her back...

**Break:** \{42:19\}

**Amal Hussein:** I am back!

**Jerod Santo:** Okay! We were nervous.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh my god, I'm so scared... I don't know what did I--

**Jerod Santo:** Now, because Nick has gone first, you might have a duplicate answer, okay?

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, no...

**Jerod Santo:** So if you answer the same thing he answered, you'll hear this sound, and you'll have extra time to name another one. Okay?

**Amal Hussein:** Okay, okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Now, I'm gonna ask you five things, and it's just the first thing that comes to your head.

**Amal Hussein:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Name a platform for learning frontend development.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, Frontend Masters.

**Jerod Santo:** Name something you might find in a commit message.

**Amal Hussein:** WIP.

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail sound\]

**Amal Hussein:** Um... Fix.

**Jerod Santo:** Name something you associate with Silicon Valley.

**Amal Hussein:** Douchebags. I'm just kidding... \[laughter\] Bros... Um, sorry. \[laughter\] Let's see...

**Emma Bostian:** Just go with bros. It was good.

**Amal Hussein:** How about douchebros? Just kidding. \[laughter\] No, VCs.

**Divya:** Oh, god...

**Jerod Santo:** VCs... Okay. Name a way to determine if code is bad.

**Amal Hussein:** Large, large functions.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Name something that frontend developers might swap.

**Amal Hussein:** Really? This can of worms? Um, frameworks...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Very good. How do you all feel like they did?

**Emma Bostian:** Really good.

**Jem Young:** This was solid.

**Emma Bostian:** It's so funny, because the Silicon Valley - I had the same impulse reaction.

**Nick Nisi:** I did too, actually...

**Neil Roberts:** Bros was such a good answer...

**Jerod Santo:** That one's definitely on the board, but...

**Divya:** Amal was just throwing out everything she felt... All the feelings towards Silicon Valley.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**Jem Young:** As the only person here in Silicon Valley, that hurts... You know?

**Amal Hussein:** \{44:02\} Sorry...

**Emma Bostian:** I mean...

**Jem Young:** I'm always sort of a bro... Like, half a bro. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well, let's add up your scores and see if you guys won even more winning... Name a platform for learning frontend development - Nick said Egghead; that is the number three answer, worth 14 points. And Amal said Frontend Masters; that is the number five answer, that's worth eight points. So you did very well. You did not hit number one...

**Emma Bostian:** Free Code Camp - was that number one?

**Jerod Santo:** Free Code Camp was number two at 15, and Udemy was number one, at 16.

**Divya:** Really...?

**Jem Young:** Why. I like Udemy. \[laughter\]

**Amal Hussein:** Well, you said frontend code, so I was like "Oh yeah, Frontend Masters." I'm at the point where I don't really use those tools as much...

**Emma Bostian:** No, you did really well.

**Divya:** That was pretty good, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** That was a good guess. That was the number five answer. Okay, so name something you might find in a commit message. You guys did very well on this one - WIP was Nick's answer; that's number four, with eight points... And of course, Amal, you also tried to answer that way, so you're honing in together, you're on the same wavelength... And then you said Fix, which is the number one answer, with 21 points.

**Jem Young:** Nice! Nice.

**Emma Bostian:** I was gonna say SHA-1, and then I realized that's not part of a message, hopefully... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Not the message... Unless you read -- I just read the SHAs now.

**Divya:** I was gonna say swear, if I had to choose...

**Jem Young:** I would have said a profanity.

**Jerod Santo:** Swearing was in there. That's the number seven answer. Also, "Oops!", ticket number reference...

**Amal Hussein:** Oops, I did it again... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** "Fixed it for real this time", that was another one...

**Amal Hussein:** ...like Britney Spears...

**Jem Young:** I love that one.

**Amal Hussein:** I have messages like that, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Name something that you associate with Silicon Valley... Nick said money; that's the number two answer, worth 12 points. Amal said VCs... That one didn't actually even make the list. It was mentioned, but only a couple times. Number one was "high cost of living", with 18. Money again, with 12. The show - when they think of Silicon Valley, they think of the show; worth eight. Income inequality was number four...

**Amal Hussein:** Wow, that got real deep, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Startups was number five...

**Divya:** That's very woke. Some woke responses.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah... Really woke

**Jerod Santo:** And number six was tech bros / jerks. So you could have went with that answer...

**Amal Hussein:** Wait, hold on--

**Divya:** You almost got it!

**Jerod Santo:** But you kept talking and changed it.

**Emma Bostian:** I think we should give it to her, because she was trying to make this family-friendly.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Divya:** It's true, yeah.

**Emma Bostian:** Even though she said douche about five times.

**Amal Hussein:** Sorry.

**Jerod Santo:** We're gonna have a lot of bleeps on this episode.

**Amal Hussein:** You mean six times now? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** We're gonna have to bleep out OnlyFans as well... And again, because I just said it again.

**Jem Young:** How am I gonna make money? You know I've got a family to feed... Come on, Jerod. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** "Name a way to determine if code is bad", and Nick said linting. That was the number six answer, with eight votes. And Amal said large functions - that's lost into the number three answer, which was kind of like verbosity, duplication, long function...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, verbosity.

**Emma Bostian:** What about nesting?

**Neil Roberts:** Where does testing score on this? \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** So the number one answer was code smells, which is kind of a--

**Jem Young:** Arrggh...!

**Amal Hussein:** I mean, long functions are a code smell.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. It's a subtype. Yeah, I know.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah. But anyways...

**Jerod Santo:** Number two was "Read it", or "See if it's readable", which again, smells and readability... Verbosity was three. Tests was number four; or not tests, or bad tests. Number five was "Run it" or "Execute it", or "Does it work?" Six was linter, like we said, and then seven was inconsistencies.

**Amal Hussein:** "Does it work on your machine...?" \[laughter\]

**Divya:** "It works on mine..."

**Amal Hussein:** "Because it works on mine..." Exactly. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** That's something you should have in commit messages, "It works on my machine..." \[laughter\] Name something that frontenders might swap... Nick said configs. That one was not on the list at all. Amal said frameworks. That was the number two answer, so that gave you 10 points.

**Nick Nisi:** How do you swap a framework?

**Jerod Santo:** The number one answer there was stickers. Frontenders swap stickers.

**Divya:** Oh... Physically swapping.

**Jerod Santo:** What's interesting is this one was interpreted both ways.

**Emma Bostian:** I was thinking spit, but...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** That was an answer.

**Amal Hussein:** Wait, what?! Like S-P-I-T? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** \{47:58\} Yeah, like they swap spit.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, just because that's a phrase. Like, swapping spit. I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Divya:** I have never heard this phrase. \[unintelligible 00:48:02.29\]

**Neil Roberts:** Yeah, developers are notorious for their--

**Divya:** What is this phrase...?!

**Emma Bostian:** I'm single in a foreign country, what do you want from me? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Emma also answered she's coding in bed; it was Emma's last Frontend Feud answer.

**Amal Hussein:** Oh, really? Coding in bed... \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** I'm \[unintelligible 00:48:17.00\]

**Jerod Santo:** So stickers was number one, frameworks was number two... Moving on. CSS classes... Now, see, here they're swapping classes, so that's more like a technical term. Stories, horror stories, war stories etc. They swap code...

**Amal Hussein:** War stories?

**Jerod Santo:** That's what they said, war stories. Swap code, or snippets, that kind of stuff... And then the last one was--

**Divya:** Is stylesheets on there?

**Jerod Santo:** ...links and social handles. You know, like "Hey, give me your social handle. Let's swap links." Link swap.

**Neil Roberts:** The classic developer catchphrase.

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** So adding it up, the Money Round here... The two of you together scored 104 points.

**Amal Hussein:** Nice!

**Jerod Santo:** That's more than a hundred, which was your goal.

**Jem Young:** Nice.

**Jerod Santo:** So you guys win again. Congratulations!

**Emma Bostian:** Finally, Jem can stop complaining about carrying the team... \[laughter\]

**Jem Young:** I mean, did I get us here? Yes. Did I massively offload the burden to the two people I delegated...?

**Emma Bostian:** I like that you're giving an inspirational speech to this applause. \[laughter\]

**Jem Young:** Exactly. I like to think all the people who didn't help me - that'd be Emma, Neil and Divya - you all didn't help me at all...

**Divya:** We gave you moral support.

**Jem Young:** That's true, I felt it. \{49:28\} I believed in you from the beginning, as you can tell. And you won...

**Amal Hussein:** Yeah. Thanks.

**Jem Young:** ...which is what's really important out of all this.

**Amal Hussein:** I know.

**Jem Young:** And you beat Emma, which is really what's most important out of all of this.

**Amal Hussein:** We did. We did. Thank you for letting us try and master Jem, you know...

**Neil Roberts:** \[laughter\]

**Nick Nisi:** Now I've been on the winning team both times, so...

**Jerod Santo:** That's true, Nick. The silent assassin.

**Amal Hussein:** Such humble teammates I have...
